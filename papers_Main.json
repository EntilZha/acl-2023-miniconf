media outlets, web novel platforms, and outputs of large language models.

This calls for a secure watermarking system to guarantee copyright protection through leakage tracing or ownership identification. To effectively combat piracy and protect copyrights, a multi-bit watermarking framework should be able to embed adequate bits of information and extract the watermarks in a robust manner despite possible corruption. In this work, we explore ways to advance both payload and robustness by following a well-known proposition from image watermarking and identify features in natural language that are invariant to minor corruption. Through a systematic analysis of the possible sources of errors, we further propose a corruption-resistant infill model.

While some work has been investigating how well ODQA models perform when tested for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, these studies have been conducted only under conservative shifts in data distribution and typically focus on a single component (i.e., retriever or reader) rather than an end-to-end system. This work proposes a more realistic end-to-end domain shift evaluation setting covering five diverse domains. We not only find that end-to-end models fail to generalize but that high retrieval scores often still yield poor answer prediction accuracy. To address these failures, we investigate several interventions, in the form of data augmentations, for improving model adaption and use our evaluation set to elucidate the relationship between the efficacy of an intervention scheme and the particular type of dataset shifts we consider. We propose a generalizability test that estimates the type of shift in a target dataset without training a model in the target domain and that the type of shift is predictive of which data augmentation schemes will be effective for domain adaption. Overall, we find that these interventions increase end-to-end performance by up to ~24 points.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.807","authors":["Dheeru Dua","Emma Strubell","Sameer Singh","Pat Verga"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Question Answering","event_ids":["session-1_-question-answering-(oral)"],"id":"P1022","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.807.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76217/poster_document/42950ede03137c1c85aca00d334d25dd.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76217/poster/e8ab469e0e837ac11054f9e604efbff1.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"To Adapt or to Annotate: Challenges and Interventions for Domain Adaptation in Open-Domain Question Answering","tldr":"Recent advances in open-domain question answering (ODQA) have demonstrated impressive accuracy on general-purpose domains like Wikipedia.

Based on these observations, we propose a simple but effective method combining the advantages of PH and CS. This approach involves training a model like PH to predict the term labels, and then during inference replacing those labels with target terminology text like CS, so that the subsequent generation is aware of the target term content.

First, they directly provide models with explicit table structures where row headers and column headers of the table are explicitly annotated and treated as model input during inference. Second, they only consider tables of limited types and ignore other tables especially complex tables with flexible header locations. Such simplified problem setting cannot cover practical scenarios where models need to process tables without header annotations in the inference phase or tables of different types. To address above issues, we construct a new TQA dataset with implicit and multi-type table structures, named IM-TQA, which not only requires the model to understand tables without directly available header annotations but also to handle multi-type tables including previously neglected complex tables. We investigate the performance of recent methods on our dataset and find that existing methods struggle in processing implicit and multi-type table structures. Correspondingly, we propose an RGCN-RCI framework outperforming recent baselines.

Recently, there is a growing trend of applying prompts on pre-trained language models (PLMs), which has exhibited effectiveness in the few-shot flat text classification tasks. However, limited work has studied the paradigm of prompt-based learning in the HTC problem when the training data is extremely scarce. In this work, we define a path-based few-shot setting and establish a strict path-based evaluation metric to further explore few-shot HTC tasks. To address the issue, we propose the hierarchical verbalizer (\"HierVerb\"), a multi-verbalizer framework treating HTC as a single- or multi-label classification problem at multiple layers and learning vectors as verbalizers constrained by hierarchical structure and hierarchical contrastive learning. In this manner, HierVerb fuses label hierarchy knowledge into verbalizers and remarkably outperforms those who inject hierarchy through graph encoders, maximizing the benefits of PLMs. Extensive experiments on three popular HTC datasets under the few-shot settings demonstrate that prompt with HierVerb significantly boosts the HTC performance, meanwhile indicating an elegant way to bridge the gap between the large pre-trained model and downstream hierarchical classification tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.164","authors":["Ke Ji","Yixin Lian","Jingsheng Gao","Baoyuan Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1071","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.164.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76524/poster_document/ecedaee0ff67396f1d6ccff179da5916.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76524/poster/ad5c072ff86a7cdf02e3b84866a1a738.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76524/slideshow/a9a0e26162e64fcef49342a4765b3e6b.pptx","title":"Hierarchical Verbalizer for Few-Shot Hierarchical Text Classification","tldr":"Due to the complex label hierarchy and intensive labeling cost in practice, the hierarchical text classification (HTC) suffers a poor performance especially when low-resource or few-shot settings are considered.

Enriching the fine-tuning data with such diverse reasoning results in a substantial performance boost across datasets, even for very small models.

Existing dual-encoder methods in HTC achieve weak performance gains with huge memory overheads and their structure encoders heavily rely on domain knowledge. Under such observation, we tend to investigate the feasibility of a memory-friendly model with strong generalization capability that could boost the performance of HTC without prior statistics or label semantics. In this paper, we propose Hierarchy-aware Tree Isomorphism Network (HiTIN) to enhance the text representations with only syntactic information of the label hierarchy. Specifically, we convert the label hierarchy into an unweighted tree structure, termed coding tree, with the guidance of structural entropy. Then we design a structure encoder to incorporate hierarchy-aware information in the coding tree into text representations. Besides the text encoder, HiTIN only contains a few multi-layer perceptions and linear transformations, which greatly saves memory.

However, our research indicates that token-level alignment is also crucial in multilingual scenarios, which has not been fully explored previously. Based on our findings, we propose a dual-alignment pre-training (DAP) framework for cross-lingual sentence embedding that incorporates both sentence-level and token-level alignment. To achieve this, we introduce a novel representation translation learning (RTL) task, where the model learns to use one-side contextualized token representation to reconstruct its translation counterpart. This reconstruction objective encourages the model to embed translation information into the token representation. Compared to other token-level alignment methods such as translation language modeling, RTL is more suitable for dual encoder architectures and is computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on three sentence-level cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve sentence embedding.

Moreover, the limited amount of available training data leads to subpar performance in out-of-domain and cross-target scenarios, as data-driven approaches are prone to rely on superficial and domain-specific features.\nIn this work, we decompose the stance detection task from a linguistic perspective, and investigate key components and inference paths in this task. The stance triangle is a generic linguistic framework previously proposed to describe the fundamental ways people express their stance. We further expand it by characterizing the relationship between explicit and implicit objects. We then use the framework to extend one single training corpus with additional annotation.

Existing VSD work merely models the 2D geometrical vision features, thus inevitably falling prey to the problem of skewed spatial understanding of target objects. In this work, we investigate the incorporation of 3D scene features for VSD. With an external 3D scene extractor, we obtain the 3D objects and scene features for input images, based on which we construct a target object-centered 3D spatial scene graph (Go3D-S2G), such that we model the spatial semantics of target objects within the holistic 3D scenes.

In detail, the full and equivalent connections among utterances in regular Transformer ignore the sparse but distinctive dependency of an utterance on another in MPCs. To distinguish different relationships between utterances, four types of edges are designed to integrate graph-induced signals into attention mechanisms to refine PLMs originally designed for processing sequential texts. We evaluate GIFT by implementing it into three PLMs, and test the performance on three downstream tasks including addressee recognition, speaker identification and response selection. Experimental results show that GIFT can significantly improve the performance of three PLMs on three downstream tasks and two benchmarks with only 4 additional parameters per encoding layer, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on MPC understanding.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.651","authors":["Jia-Chen Gu","Zhenhua Ling","Quan Liu","Cong Liu","Guoping Hu"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-3_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(oral)"],"id":"P1148","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.651.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76220/poster_document/51cc2afc36a2af097c5072b02e2576f1.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76220/poster/b6c2bb1993d4852574834c4ca2b3ee90.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"GIFT: Graph-Induced Fine-Tuning for Multi-Party Conversation Understanding","tldr":"Addressing the issues of who saying what to whom in multi-party conversations (MPCs) has recently attracted a lot of research attention.

In this paper, we address the problem of hallucination detection in NMT by following a simple intuition: as hallucinations are detached from the source content, they exhibit encoder-decoder attention patterns that are statistically different from those of good quality translations. We frame this problem with an optimal transport formulation and propose a fully unsupervised, plug-in detector that can be used with any attention-based NMT model.

In this paper, we analyze the complementary characteristic of both methods and propose a multi-level knowledge distillation approach that integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, we use a fine-tuned model as the teacher to teach a randomly initialized student model on the ID examples. Besides the prediction layer distillation, we present a similarity-based intermediate layer distillation method to thoroughly explore the representation space of the teacher model. In this way, the learned student can better represent the ID data manifold while gaining a stronger ability to map OoD examples outside the ID data manifold with the regularization inherited from pre-training. Besides, the student model sees only ID examples during parameter learning, further promoting more distinguishable features for OoD detection. We conduct extensive experiments over multiple benchmark datasets, i.e., CLINC150, SST, ROSTD, 20 NewsGroups, and AG News; showing that the proposed method yields new state-of-the-art performance.

To adapt PTMs with model parameters frozen, most current approaches focus on the input side, seeking powerful prompts to stimulate models for correct answers. However, we argue that input-side adaptation could be arduous due to the lack of gradient signals and they usually require thousands of API queries, resulting in high computation and time costs. Specifically, DecT first extracts prompt-stimulated output scores for initial predictions. On top of that, we train an additional decoder network on the output representations to incorporate posterior data knowledge.

However, these neural metrics, while achieving higher correlations with human evaluations, are often considered to be black boxes with potential biases that are difficult to detect. In this study, we systematically analyze and compare various mainstream and cutting-edge automatic metrics from the perspective of their guidance for training machine translation systems. Through Minimum Risk Training (MRT), we find that certain metrics exhibit robustness defects, such as the presence of universal adversarial translations in BLEURT and BARTScore. In-depth analysis suggests two main causes of these robustness deficits: distribution biases in the training datasets, and the tendency of the metric paradigm. By incorporating token-level constraints, we enhance the robustness of evaluation metrics, which in turn leads to an improvement in the performance of machine translation systems.

Most existing methods either cannot transfer prior knowledge contained in known intents or fall into the dilemma of forgetting prior knowledge in the follow-up. Furthermore, these methods do not deeply explore the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data, and as a result, cannot seek out the characteristics that define an intent in general. In this paper, starting from the intuition that discovering intents could be beneficial for identifying known intents, we propose a probabilistic framework for discovering intents where intent assignments are treated as latent variables. We adopt the Expectation Maximization framework for optimization. Specifically, In the E-step, we conduct intent discovery and explore the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data by the posterior of intent assignments. In the M-step, we alleviate the forgetting of prior knowledge transferred from known intents by optimizing the discrimination of labeled data. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed framework and implementation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.209","authors":["Yunhua Zhou","Guofeng Quan","Xipeng Qiu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1213","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.209.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76553/poster_document/c16e3e48de41dbf97a9858fcd4090c17.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76553/poster/e44f0388827a092228841d274e2a0e7f.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76553/slideshow/ceabec0482ed2d0363716f27e50e3979.pptx","title":"A Probabilistic Framework for Discovering New Intents","tldr":"Discovering new intents is of great significance for establishing the Task-Oriented Dialogue System.

Several methods have been introduced to provide insight into the inference process of deep neural networks. However, most of these explainability methods have been shown to be brittle in the face of adversarial perturbations of their inputs in the image and generic textual domain. In this work we show that this phenomenon extends to specific and important high stakes domains like biomedical datasets. In particular, we observe that the robustness of explanations should be characterized in terms of the accuracy of the explanation in linking a model's inputs and its decisions - faithfulness - and its relevance from the perspective of domain experts - plausibility. This is crucial to prevent explanations that are inaccurate but still look convincing in the context of the domain at hand. To this end, we show how to adapt current attribution robustness estimation methods to a given domain, so as to take into account domain-specific plausibility. This results in our DomainAdaptiveAREstimator (DARE) attribution robustness estimator, allowing us to properly characterize the domain-specific robustness of faithful explanations. Next, we provide two methods, adversarial training and FAR training, to mitigate the brittleness characterized by DARE, allowing us to train networks that display robust attributions.

To adopt prompt learning in the NER task, two kinds of methods have been explored from a pair of symmetric perspectives, populating the template by enumerating spans to predict their entity types or constructing type-specific prompts to locate entities. However, these methods not only require a multi-round prompting manner with a high time overhead and computational cost, but also require elaborate prompt templates, that are difficult to apply in practical scenarios. In this paper, we unify entity locating and entity typing into prompt learning, and design a dual-slot multi-prompt template with the position slot and type slot to prompt locating and typing respectively. Multiple prompts can be input to the model simultaneously, and then the model extracts all entities by parallel predictions on the slots. To assign labels for the slots during training, we design a dynamic template filling mechanism that uses the extended bipartite graph matching between prompts and the ground-truth entities. We conduct experiments in various settings, including resource-rich flat and nested NER datasets and low-resource in-domain and cross-domain datasets.

Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world's languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.66","authors":["Richeek Das","Sahasra Ranjan","Shreya Pathak","Preethi Jyothi"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","event_ids":["session-7_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1315","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.66.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76568/poster_document/8b0bf008ac38dd28542caa9b124ba547.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76568/poster/00a07aa1f155a88fe6206102279d5003.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76568/slideshow/320721d4bffd2c2beedf74225d0e5710.pdf","title":"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP","tldr":"Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications.

However, it is still unclear what the underlying capabilities of these LMs are. Surprisingly, we find that these models have limitations on certain basic symbolic manipulation tasks such as copy, reverse, and addition. When the total number of symbols or repeating symbols increases, the model performance drops quickly. We investigate the potential causes behind this phenomenon and examine a set of possible methods, including explicit positional markers, fine-grained computation steps, and LMs with callable programs.

Dialogs in comic strips is a unique and unexplored area where every strip contains utterances from various characters with each one building upon the previous utterances and the associated visual scene. Previous works like DialoGPT, PersonaGPT and other dialog generation models encode two-party dialogues and do not account for the visual information. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to propose the paradigm of multimodal persona based dialogue generation. We contribute a novel dataset, ComSet, consisting of 54K strips, harvested from 13 popular comics available online. Further, we propose a multimodal persona-based architecture, MPDialog, to generate dialogues for the next panel in the strip which decreases the perplexity score by ~10 points over strong dialogue generation baseline models. We demonstrate that there is still ample opportunity for improvement, highlighting the importance of building stronger dialogue systems that are able to generate persona-consistent dialogues and understand the context through various modalities.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.791","authors":["Harsh Agrawal","Aditya M.

However, it is unclear how broadly these trends hold. We conduct a large empirical study across three tasks, three broadly-applicable modeling interventions (increasing model size, using a different adaptation method, and pre-training on more data), and 14 diverse datasets to investigate the relationship between sample efficiency (amount of data needed to reach a given ID accuracy) and robustness (how models fare on OOD evaluation). We find that higher sample efficiency is only correlated with better average OOD robustness on some modeling interventions and tasks, but not others. On individual datasets, models with lower sample efficiency can even be more robust. These results suggest that general-purpose methods for improving sample efficiency are unlikely to yield universal OOD robustness improvements, since such improvements are highly dataset- and task-dependent.

It is primarily determined by the size of the language adaptation data.

While temporal reasoning models can perform reasonably well on in-domain benchmarks, we have little idea of these systems' generalizability due to existing datasets' limitations. In this work, we introduce a novel task named TODAY that bridges this gap with temporal differential analysis, which as the name suggests, evaluates whether systems can correctly understand the effect of incremental changes. Specifically, TODAY introduces slight contextual changes for given event pairs, and systems are asked to tell how this subtle contextual change would affect relevant temporal relation distributions. To facilitate learning, TODAY also annotates human explanations. We show that existing models, including GPT-3.5, drop to random guessing on TODAY, suggesting that they heavily rely on spurious information rather than proper reasoning for temporal predictions. On the other hand, we show that TODAY's supervision style and explanation annotations can be used in joint learning, encouraging models to use more appropriate signals during training and thus outperform across several benchmarks. TODAY can also be used to train models to solicit incidental supervision from noisy sources such as GPT-3.5, thus moving us more toward the goal of generic temporal reasoning systems.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.671","authors":["Yu Feng","Ben Zhou","Haoyu Wang","Helen Jin","Dan Roth"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference, and Other Areas","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(poster)"],"id":"P1424","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.671.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76581/poster_document/b95996c364f7d4a66b77d795ef65b377.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76581/poster/33286a9e98a517c196fad9aad31926eb.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76581/slideshow/b1d9a1bc157009ca4913eb5f243e37ae.pdf","title":"Generic Temporal Reasoning with Differential Analysis and Explanation","tldr":"Temporal reasoning is the task of predicting temporal relations of event pairs.

In this paper, we introduce Z-ICL, a new zero-shot method that closes the gap by constructing pseudo-demonstrations for a given test input using a raw text corpus. Concretely, pseudo-demonstrations are constructed by (1) finding the nearest neighbors to the test input from the corpus and pairing them with random task labels, and (2) applying a set of techniques to reduce the amount of direct copying the model does from the resulting demonstrations. Evaluation on nine classification datasets shows that Z-ICL outperforms previous zero-shot methods by a significant margin, and is on par with in-context learning with labeled training data in the few-shot setting. Overall, Z-ICL provides a significantly higher estimate of the zero-shot performance levels of a model, and supports future efforts to develop better pseudo-demonstrations that further improve zero-shot results.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.129","authors":["Xinxi Lyu","Sewon Min","Iz Beltagy","Luke Zettlemoyer","Hannaneh Hajishirzi"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P1448","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.129.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76583/poster_document/bfdce4acdf0a6a42bf897c14c05f8f0c.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76583/poster/eb62cfb0ce8651fe5c36bb0453fd9d3c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76583/slideshow/e13a0ffb4a939d3268752d988cdd005d.pptx","title":"Z-ICL: Zero-Shot In-Context Learning with Pseudo-Demonstrations","tldr":"Although large language models can be prompted for both zero- and few-shot learning, performance drops significantly when no demonstrations are available.

The integration of external commonsense into language models has been shown to be a key enabler in advancing the state-of-the-art for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, incorporating textual commonsense descriptions is computationally expensive, as compared to encoding conventional symbolic knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to improve its efficiency without modifying the model. Our idea is to group training samples with similar commonsense descriptions into a single batch, thus reusing the encoded description across multiple samples. We theoretically investigate this problem and demonstrate that its upper bound can be reduced to the classic {\\it graph k-cut problem}. Consequently, we propose a spectral clustering-based algorithm to solve this problem. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed batch partitioning approach effectively reduces the computational cost while preserving performance. The efficiency improvement is more pronounced on larger datasets and on devices with more memory capacity, attesting to its practical utility for large-scale applications.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.208","authors":["Wanyun Cui","Xingran Chen"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-7_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1459","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.208.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76588/poster_document/ed18229b495904693d164fc87287cc9a.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76588/poster/5a009b7922155118a345c8b65b78eb97.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76588/slideshow/a0bd5e718ce61718c0527240e2198bce.pdf","title":"Free Lunch for Efficient Textual Commonsense Integration in Language Models","tldr":"Recent years have witnessed the emergence of textual commonsense knowledge bases, aimed at providing more nuanced and context-rich knowledge.

The context, comprising utterances from previous dialogue exchanges, is used as a source of content for response generation and as a means of selecting external knowledge. However, to avoid introducing irrelevant content, it is key to enable fine-grained scoring of context and knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel approach to context and knowledge weighting as an integral part of model training.\nWe guide the model training through a Contextual Knowledge Learning (CKL) process which involves Latent Vectors for context and knowledge, respectively. CKL Latent Vectors capture the relationship between context, knowledge, and responses through weak supervision and enable differential weighting of context utterances and knowledge sentences during the training process. Experiments with two standard datasets and human evaluation demonstrate that CKL leads to a significant improvement compared with the performance of six strong baseline models and shows robustness with regard to reduced sizes of training sets.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.433","authors":["Wen Zheng","Natasa Milic-Frayling","Ke Zhou"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(poster)"],"id":"P1466","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.433.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76589/poster_document/44d6fbc1b4fb31ce47d53d8e6512cb51.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76589/poster/6f8eabe98ae4946f5e18764991aa1f03.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Contextual Knowledge Learning for Dialogue Generation","tldr":"Incorporating conversational context and knowledge into dialogue generation models has been essential for improving the quality of the generated responses.

However, previous studies concentrate on the token or sentence level, such as sentence sentiment and formality transfer, but neglect long style transfer at the discourse level. Long texts usually involve more complicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than sentences. In this paper, we formulate the task of non-parallel story author-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a specified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder. Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation. Furthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms strong baselines in overall performance of style transfer and content preservation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.827","authors":["Xuekai Zhu","Jian Guan","Minlie Huang","Juan Liu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","event_ids":["session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1471","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.827.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76590/poster_document/c0cbedba19ebd4d3922b5f3ec07352fe.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76590/poster/d9ad6b6317056332797f6ad9a5198388.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing","tldr":"Non-parallel text style transfer is an important task in natural language generation.

Recent literature has tackled low-resource RE by self-supervised learning, where the solution involves pretraining the entity pair embedding by RE-based objective and finetuning on labeled data by classification-based objective. However, a critical challenge to this approach is the gap in objectives, which prevents the RE model from fully utilizing the knowledge in pretrained representations. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap and propose to pretrain and finetune the RE model using consistent objectives of contrastive learning. Since in this kind of representation learning paradigm, one relation may easily form multiple clusters in the representation space, we further propose a multi-center contrastive loss that allows one relation to form multiple clusters to better align with pretraining.

Then the reconstruct-based learning encourages the AVMM to learn ``which pixels belong to the same sound'' and achieve audio-enhanced visual prefix. The well-trained AVMM can be further applied to uni-modal setting.

Density-based estimation is widely considered as an effective technique by explicitly modeling the distribution of normal data and identifying adversarial ones as outliers. However, these methods suffer from significant performance degradation when the adversarial samples lie close to the non-adversarial data manifold. To address this limitation, we propose a score-based generative method to implicitly model the data distribution. Our approach utilizes the gradient of the log-density data distribution and calculates the distribution gap between adversarial and normal samples through multi-step iterations using Langevin dynamics. In addition, we use supervised contrastive learning to guide the gradient estimation using label information, which avoids collapsing to a single data manifold and better preserves the anisotropy of the different labeled data distributions. Experimental results on three text classification tasks upon four advanced attack algorithms show that our approach is a significant improvement (average +15.2 F1 score against previous SOTA) over previous detection methods.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.40","authors":["Rong Bao","Rui Zheng","Liang Ding","Qi Zhang","Dacheng Tao"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1509","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.40.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76598/poster_document/ff3d94e693b5a823ee9045c9da787845.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76598/poster/a24bde79c15ba967a9e333d64345e609.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"CASN:Class-Aware Score Network for Textual Adversarial Detection","tldr":"Adversarial detection aims to detect adversarial samples that threaten the security of deep neural networks, which is an essential step toward building robust AI systems.

Recently, the detection-based OIE methods have received great attention from the community due to their parallelism. However, as the essential step of those models, how to assign ground truth labels to the parallelly generated tuple proposals remains under-exploited. The commonly utilized Hungarian algorithm for this procedure is restricted to handling one-to-one assignment among the desired tuples and tuple proposals, which ignores the correlation between proposals and affects the recall of the models. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic many-to-one label assignment strategy named IOT. Concretely, the label assignment process in OIE is formulated as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem.

Pre-training is commonly regarded as an effective approach for multi-modal dialogue. However, due to the limited availability of multi-modal dialogue data, there is still scarce research on multi-modal dialogue pre-training. Yet another intriguing challenge emerges from the encompassing nature of multi-modal dialogue, which involves various modalities and tasks. Moreover, new forms of tasks may arise at unpredictable points in the future. Hence, it is essential for designed multi-modal dialogue models to possess sufficient flexibility to adapt to such scenarios. This paper proposes PaCE, a unified, structured, compositional multi-modal dialogue pre-training framework. It utilizes a combination of several fundamental experts to accommodate multiple dialogue-related tasks and can be pre-trained using limited dialogue and extensive non-dialogue multi-modal data. Furthermore, we propose a progressive training method where old experts from the past can assist new experts, facilitating the expansion of their capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art results on eight multi-modal dialog benchmarks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.749","authors":["Yunshui Li","Binyuan Hui","ZhiChao Yin","Min Yang","Fei Huang","Yongbin Li"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-1_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1605","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.749.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76610/poster_document/b8a39f0c04b0215157269db3fbca3001.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76610/poster/f8563576a01701051394f11b1d09456a.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76610/slideshow/cc3170c22cb3d3825d1b5f9cd3795460.pptx","title":"PaCE: Unified Multi-modal Dialogue Pre-training with Progressive and Compositional Experts","tldr":"Perceiving multi-modal information and fulfilling dialogues with humans is a long-term goal of artificial intelligence.

In particular, we design the path aggregator and the relation-enhanced self-attention mechanism that complement each other.

Most previous debiasing techniques used Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) to balance the training corpus. However, CDA slightly modifies the original corpus, limiting the representation distance between different demographic groups to a narrow range. As a result, the debiasing model easily fits the differences between counterfactual pairs, which affects its debiasing performance with limited text resources. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training-inspired two-stage debiasing model using Contrastive learning with Continuous Prompt Augmentation (named CCPA) to mitigate social biases in PLMs' encoding. In the first stage, we propose a data augmentation method based on continuous prompt tuning to push farther the representation distance between sample pairs along different demographic groups. In the second stage, we utilize contrastive learning to pull closer the representation distance between the augmented sample pairs and then fine-tune PLMs' parameters to get debiased encoding. Our approach guides the model to achieve stronger debiasing performance by adding difficulty to the training process. Extensive experiments show that CCPA outperforms baselines in terms of debiasing performance. Meanwhile, experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that CCPA retains the language modeling capability of PLMs.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.797","authors":["Yingji Li","Mengnan Du","Xin Wang","Ying Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Ethics and NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-ethics-and-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1674","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.797.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76616/poster_document/2ef434b80d9635ada89a7f6b555c1ebd.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76616/poster/b66b63a91e9d566b1a4bdcebfdf33ce7.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76616/slideshow/9074e6671c895cd15f9c5232147570a1.pptx","title":"Prompt Tuning Pushes Farther, Contrastive Learning Pulls Closer: A Two-Stage Approach to Mitigate Social Biases","tldr":"As the representation capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) improve, there is growing concern that they will inherit social biases from unprocessed corpora.

The key idea is to have some layers of the encoder be source or target language-specific, while keeping the remaining layers shared. We study the best way to place these layers using a neural architecture search inspired approach, and achieve an improvement of 1.3 chrF (1.5 spBLEU) points over not using LSLs on a separate decoder architecture, and 1.9 chrF (2.2 spBLEU) on a shared decoder one.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.825","authors":["Telmo Pires","Robin M.

Prior works on pretraining language models to improve the logical reasoning ability require complex processing of training data (e.g., aligning symbolic knowledge to text), yielding task-specific data augmentation that is not easy to adapt to any general text corpus. In this work, we propose APOLLO, a simple adaptive pretraining approach to improve the logical reasoning skills of language models. We select a subset of Wikipedia for adaptive pretraining using a set of logical inference keywords as filter words. Further, we propose two self-supervised loss functions for training. First, we modify the masked language modeling loss only to mask specific parts-of-speech words that likely require higher-order reasoning to predict them. Second, we propose a sentence-level classification loss that teaches the model to distinguish between entailment and contradiction types of sentences. The proposed pretraining paradigm is both simple and independent of task formats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of APOLLO by comparing it with prior baselines on two logical reasoning datasets. APOLLO performs comparably on ReClor and outperforms baselines on LogiQA.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.347","authors":["Soumya Sanyal","Yichong Xu","Shuohang Wang","Ziyi Yang","Reid Pryzant","Wenhao Yu","Chenguang Zhu","Xiang Ren"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference, and Other Areas","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(poster)"],"id":"P1695","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.347.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76620/poster_document/555ff140af1b88f7437cff9d2a2630fe.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76620/poster/73bbd4146c6cab36f05ffa8e58666270.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"APOLLO: A Simple Approach for Adaptive Pretraining of Language Models for Logical Reasoning","tldr":"Logical reasoning over text is an important ability that requires understanding the semantics of the text and reasoning through them to arrive at correct inferences.

We investigate these differences in conceptualization across 1,335 languages by aligning concepts in a parallel corpus. To this end, we propose Conceptualizer, a method that creates a bipartite directed alignment graph between source language concepts and sets of target language strings. In a detailed linguistic analysis across all languages for one concept ('bird') and an evaluation on gold standard data for 32 Swadesh concepts, we show that Conceptualizer has good alignment accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of research on conceptualization in NLP with two experiments.

(2) We represent each language by its conceptualization pattern for 83 concepts, and define a similarity measure on these representations. The resulting measure for the conceptual similarity between two languages is complementary to standard genealogical, typological, and surface similarity measures. For four out of six language families, we can assign languages to their correct family based on conceptual similarity with accuracies between 54\\% and 87\\%","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.726","authors":["Yihong Liu","Haotian Ye","Leonie Weissweiler","Philipp Wicke","Renhao Pei","Robert Zangenfeind","Hinrich Sch\u00fctze"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P1737","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.726.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76628/poster_document/4fcb0930ac735b77daa3f6682dacca74.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76628/poster/84fa37d6f92ad242b6a3305496268aaf.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76628/slideshow/8bfd2576cea7fcf8e04bd0527cab4c28.pdf","title":"A Crosslingual Investigation of Conceptualization in 1335 Languages","tldr":"Languages differ in how they divide up the world into concepts and words; e.g., in contrast to English, Swahili has a single concept for 'belly' and 'womb'.

In practice, Shapley Values are often estimated with a small number of stochastic model evaluations. However, we show that the estimated Shapley Values are sensitive to random seed choices -- the top-ranked features often have little overlap across different seeds, especially on examples with longer input texts. This can only be mitigated by aggregating thousands of model evaluations, which on the other hand, induces substantial computational overheads. To mitigate the trade-off between stability and efficiency, we develop an amortized model that directly predicts each input feature's Shapley Value without additional model evaluations. It is trained on a set of examples whose Shapley Values are estimated from a large number of model evaluations to ensure stability. Experimental results on two text classification datasets demonstrate that our amortized model estimates Shapley Values accurately with up to 60 times speedup compared to traditional methods. Further, our model does not suffer from stability issues as inference is deterministic.

This can lead to the hallucination problem, where target tokens are generated without support from the source sentence.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages traditional translation models as teachers and employs a two-stage beam search algorithm to generate monotonic yet accurate reference translations for sequence-level knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by our approach over multiple strong SiMT baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performance across various language pairs. Notably, when evaluated on a monotonic version of the WMT15 De-En test set, which includes references generated in a more monotonic style by professional translators, our approach achieves even more substantial improvement over the baselines.

This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at expanding the understanding of CR in NMT.\nFor the training, we confirm the effectiveness of incorporating pretrained knowledge into NMT models and subsequently utilizing these models as robust testbeds for investigating CR in NMT.

In this work, we propose a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models. Different from common approaches that prune each attention head as a whole, GRAIN inspects and prunes intra-attention structures, which greatly expands the structure search space and enables more flexible models. We also propose a gradient separation strategy that reduces the interference of distillation on pruning for a better combination of the two approaches.

In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

Unfortunately, most meta-evaluation studies focus on European languages, the observations for which may not always apply to other languages. Indian languages, having over a billion speakers, are linguistically different from them, and to date, there are no such systematic studies focused solely on English to Indian language MT. This paper fills this gap through a Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) dataset consisting of 7000 fine-grained annotations, spanning 5 Indian languages and 7 MT systems. We evaluate 16 metrics and show that, pre-trained metrics like COMET have the highest correlations with annotator scores as opposed to n-gram metrics like BLEU. We further leverage our MQM annotations to develop an Indic-COMET metric and show that it outperforms COMET counterparts in both human scores correlations and robustness scores in Indian languages.

Our backdoored model is pre-trained with two learning strategies (i.e., Poisoned Seq2Seq learning and token representation learning) to support the multi-target attack of downstream code understanding and generation tasks. During the deployment phase, the implanted backdoors in the victim models can be activated by the designed triggers to achieve the targeted attack. We evaluate our approach on two code understanding tasks and three code generation tasks over seven datasets.

Since most research investigating compositional generalization in NLP is done on English, important questions remain underexplored. Do the necessary compositional generalization abilities differ across languages? Can models compositionally generalize cross-lingually? As a first step to answering these questions, recent work used neural machine translation to translate datasets for evaluating compositional generalization in semantic parsing. However, we show that this entails critical semantic distortion. To address this limitation, we craft a faithful rule-based translation of the MCWQ dataset from English to Chinese and Japanese. Even with the resulting robust benchmark, which we call MCWQ-R, we show that the distribution of compositions still suffers due to linguistic divergences, and that multilingual models still struggle with cross-lingual compositional generalization.

Some existing solutions draw external knowledge into the cross-modality space which overlooks the much vaster textual knowledge in natural-language space, while others transform the image into a text which further fuses with the textual knowledge into the natural-language space and completely abandons the use of visual features. In this paper, we are inspired to constrain the cross-modality space into the same space of natural-language space which makes the visual features preserved directly, and the model still benefits from the vast knowledge in natural-language space. To this end, we propose a novel framework consisting of a multimodal encoder, a textual encoder and an answer decoder. Such structure allows us to introduce more types of knowledge including explicit and implicit multimodal and textual knowledge.

Conventionally, annotator disagreements are resolved before any learning takes place. However, researchers are increasingly identifying annotator disagreement as pervasive and meaningful. They also question the performance of a system when annotators disagree. Particularly when minority views are disregarded, especially among groups that may already be underrepresented in the annotator population. In this paper, we introduce CrowdOpinion, an unsupervised learning based approach that uses language features and label distributions to pool similar items into larger samples of label distributions. We experiment with four generative and one density-based clustering method, applied to five linear combinations of label distributions and features.

Existing models mainly adopt a retriever-reader framework, which have several deficiencies, such as noisy labeling in training retriever, insufficient utilization of heterogeneous information over text and table, and deficient ability for different reasoning operations. In this paper, we propose a three-stage TextTableQA framework S3HQA, which comprises of retriever, selector, and reasoner. We use a retriever with refinement training to solve the noisy labeling problem. Then, a hybrid selector considers the linked relationships between heterogeneous data to select the most relevant factual knowledge. For the final stage, instead of adapting a reading comprehension module like in previous methods, we employ a generation-based reasoner to obtain answers. This includes two approaches: a row-wise generator and an LLM prompting generator~(first time used in this task). The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results in the few-shot setting. When trained on the full dataset, our approach outperforms all baseline methods, ranking first on the HybridQA leaderboard.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.147","authors":["Fangyu Lei","Xiang Li","Yifan Wei","Shizhu He","Yiming Huang","Jun Zhao","Kang Liu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Question Answering","event_ids":["session-4_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P1970","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.147.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76655/poster_document/c9b789f2f5c62daff9ae40b232fcd792.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76655/poster/c150c0e32481a68c47ace34bd1b56fe9.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"S3HQA: A Three-Stage Approach for Multi-hop Text-Table Hybrid Question Answering","tldr":"Answering multi-hop questions over hybrid factual knowledge from the given text and table (TextTableQA) is a challenging task.

Additionally, the heterogeneity of knowledge base schema items between different knowledge bases often necessitates specialized training for different knowledge base question-answering (KBQA) datasets. To handle questions over diverse KBQA datasets with a unified training-free framework, we propose KB-BINDER, which for the first time enables few-shot in-context learning over KBQA tasks. Firstly, KB-BINDER leverages large language models like Codex to generate logical forms as the draft for a specific question by imitating a few demonstrations. Secondly,  KB-BINDER grounds on the knowledge base to bind the generated draft to an executable one with BM25 score matching. The experimental results on four public heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that KB-BINDER can achieve a strong performance with only a few in-context demonstrations. Especially on GraphQA and 3-hop MetaQA, KB-BINDER can even outperform the state-of-the-art trained models. On GrailQA and WebQSP, our model is also on par with other fully-trained models. We believe KB-BINDER can serve as an important baseline for future research. We plan to release all the code and data.

Nonetheless, the improvement offered by existing handcrafted augmentation strategies is limited when successful systematic generalization of neural sequence models requires multi-grained compositional bias (i.e., not limited to either lexical or structural biases only) or differentiation of training sequences in an imbalanced difficulty distribution. To address the two challenges, we first propose a novel compositional augmentation strategy dubbed Span Substitution (SpanSub) that enables multi-grained composition of substantial substructures in the whole training set. Over and above that, we introduce the Learning to Substitute Span (L2S2) framework which empowers the learning of span substitution probabilities in SpanSub in an end-to-end manner by maximizing the loss of neural sequence models, so as to outweigh those challenging compositions with elusive concepts and novel surroundings. Our empirical results on three standard compositional generalization benchmarks, including SCAN, COGS and GeoQuery (with an improvement of at most 66.5\\%, 10.3\\%, 1.2\\%, respectively), demonstrate the superiority of SpanSub, L2S2 and their combination.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.157","authors":["Zhaoyi Li","Ying Wei","Defu Lian"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Lexical","event_ids":["session-5_-semantics_-lexical-(oral)"],"id":"P2023","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.157.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76235/poster_document/1482d282c676f21b533bdd92858913c5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76235/poster/4d9fd8a1c5d6eef310115e022d4f0cf1.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Learning to Substitute Spans towards Improving Compositional Generalization","tldr":"Despite the rising prevalence of neural sequence models, recent empirical evidences suggest their deficiency in compositional generalization.

In this paper, we analyze and identify the psycholinguistic bias in the text and the bias of inferring news label based on only image features. We mitigate these biases from a causality perspective and propose a Causal intervention and Counterfactual reasoning based Debiasing framework (CCD) for multi-modal fake news detection. To achieve our goal, we first utilize causal intervention to remove the psycholinguistic bias which introduces the spurious correlations between text features and news label. And then, we apply counterfactual reasoning by imagining a counterfactual world where each news has only image features for estimating the direct effect of the image. Therefore we can eliminate the image-only bias by deducting the direct effect of the image from the total effect on labels.

This inspires us to develop a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the verifier. In our approach, the generator is responsible for generating reasoning paths, and the verifiers are used to supervise the evaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator.

The method works by maintaining multiple classifiers of different capacities, and allocating resources to each test instance according to its difficulty. In this work, we compare the two main approaches for adaptive inference, Early-Exit and Multi-Model, when training data is limited. First, we observe that for models with the same architecture and size, individual Multi-Model classifiers outperform their Early-Exit counterparts by an average of 2.3\\%. We show that this gap is caused by Early-Exit classifiers sharing model parameters during training, resulting in conflicting gradient updates of model weights. We find that despite this gap, Early-Exit still provides a better speed-accuracy trade-off due to the overhead of the Multi-Model approach. To address these issues, we propose SWEET (Separating Weights for Early-Exit Transformers) an Early-Exit fine-tuning method that assigns each classifier its own set of unique model weights, not updated by other classifiers. We compare SWEET's speed-accuracy curve to standard Early-Exit and Multi-Model baselines and find that it outperforms both methods at fast speeds while maintaining comparable scores to Early- Exit at slow speeds. Moreover, SWEET individual classifiers outperform Early-Exit ones by 1.1\\% on average. SWEET enjoys the benefits of both methods, paving the way for further reduction of inference costs in NLP.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.829","authors":["Daniel Rotem","Michael Hassid","Jonathan Mamou","Roy Schwartz"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P2058","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.829.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76664/poster_document/8dfef44d45a14d3b783573c42d7fd30e.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76664/poster/956557cf1e77e0ffa7d7f49d7c78f63d.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings","tldr":"Adaptive inference is a simple method for reducing inference costs.

A common way to address this problem is to use distantly annotated training data that contains incorrect labels. However, the performance of models trained solely with such data can be limited by the errors in the automatic annotation. Recently, there are a few approaches that no longer follow this conventional way. But without using sufficient direct entity typing supervision may also cause them to yield inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can avoid the need of creating distantly labeled data whenever there is a new type schema. We first train an entity typing model that have an extremely board type coverage by using the ultra-fine entity typing data. Then, when there is a need to produce a model for a newly designed fine-grained entity type schema. We can simply fine-tune the previously trained model with a small number of examples annotated under this schema. Experimental results show that our approach achieves outstanding performance for FET under the few-shot setting. It can also outperform state-of-the-art weak supervision based methods after fine-tuning the model with only a small size manually annotated training set.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.126","authors":["Hongliang Dai","Ziqian Zeng"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["session-7_-information-extraction-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P2067","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.126.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76667/poster_document/f9f2109f38356730dad3e1bda37bb3d5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76667/poster/de24c164ef1d06538685e7dac95b5e8c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"From Ultra-Fine to Fine: Fine-tuning Ultra-Fine Entity Typing Models to Fine-grained","tldr":"For the task of fine-grained entity typing (FET), due to the use of a large number of entity types, it is usually considered too costly to manually annotating a training dataset that contains an ample number of examples for each type.

Yet, standard decoding methods (i.e., beam search, nucleus sampling, and diverse beam search) produce candidates with redundant, and often low quality, content. In this paper, we design a novel method to generate candidates for re-ranking that addresses these issues.  We ground each candidate abstract on its own unique content plan and generate distinct plan-guided abstracts using a model's top beam. More concretely, a standard language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit (EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top K beams from the content plan generator are then used to guide a separate LM, which produces a single abstractive candidate for each distinct plan. We apply an existing re-ranker (BRIO) to abstractive candidates generated from our method, as well as baseline decoding methods. We show large relevance improvements over previously published methods on widely used single document news article corpora, with ROUGE-2 F1 gains of 0.88, 2.01, and 0.38 on CNN / Dailymail, NYT, and Xsum, respectively. A human evaluation on CNN / DM validates these results. Similarly, on 1k samples from CNN / DM, we show that prompting GPT-3 to follow EDU plans outperforms sampling-based methods by by 1.05 ROUGE-2 F1 points.

These details can be important for low-resourced languages that need to plan the production of datasets. We evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically the differences of five different languages with different pretraining dataset sizes and three different tokenization methods for each. The results confirm that the size of the vocabulary due to morphological characteristics is directly correlated with both the LM perplexity and the performance of two typical downstream tasks such as NER identification and POS labeling.

Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.163","authors":["Anthony B Sicilia","Malihe Alikhani"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(poster)"],"id":"P2091","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.163.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76672/poster_document/09ce4480e15e29f08ed844ca38bf7a04.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76672/poster/7133ce1591d44f8df0654ed484ad7185.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76672/slideshow/674c319968ca43a10640c8bb4f50d3b7.pdf","title":"Learning to Generate Equitable Text in Dialogue from Biased Training Data","tldr":"The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system's decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement.

To step over these obstacles, an effective way is to pre-train a model that understands the discourse structure of multi-party dialogues, namely, to whom each utterance is replying. However, due to the lack of explicitly annotated discourse labels in multi-party dialogue corpora, previous works fail to scale up the pre-training process by putting aside the unlabeled multi-party conversational data for nothing. To fully utilize the unlabeled data, we propose to treat the discourse structures as latent variables, then jointly infer them and pre-train the discourse-aware model by unsupervised latent variable inference methods. Experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our pre-trained model outperforms strong baselines by large margins and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, justifying the effectiveness of our method.

To measure robustness, several existing approaches edit the text data, but without leveraging the cross-modal information present in multimodal data. Such information from the visual modality, such as color, size, and shape, provides additional attributes that users can include in their inputs. Thus, we propose cross-modal attribute insertions as a realistic perturbation strategy for vision-and-language data that inserts visual attributes of the objects in the image into the corresponding text (e.g., \"girl on a chair'' to \"little girl on a wooden chair''). Our proposed approach for cross-modal attribute insertions is modular, controllable, and task-agnostic. We find that augmenting input text using cross-modal insertions causes state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-image retrieval and cross-modal entailment to perform poorly, resulting in relative drops of ~15\\% in MRR and ~20\\% in F1 score, respectively. Crowd-sourced annotations demonstrate that cross-modal insertions lead to higher quality augmentations for multimodal data than augmentations using text-only data, and are equivalent in quality to original examples.

While existing work primarily focused on the lexical specialization of monolingual PLMs with immense quantities of monolingual constraints, in this work we expose massively multilingual transformers (MMTs, e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) to multilingual lexical knowledge at scale, leveraging BabelNet as the readily available rich source of multilingual and cross-lingual type-level lexical knowledge. Concretely, we use BabelNet's multilingual synsets to create synonym pairs (or synonym-gloss pairs) across 50 languages and then subject the MMTs (mBERT and XLM-R) to a lexical specialization procedure guided by a contrastive objective. We show that such massively multilingual lexical specialization brings substantial gains in two standard cross-lingual lexical tasks, bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity, as well as in cross-lingual sentence retrieval. Crucially, we observe gains for languages unseen in specialization, indicating that multilingual lexical specialization enables generalization to languages with no lexical constraints. In a series of subsequent controlled experiments, we show that the number of specialization constraints plays a much greater role than the set of languages from which they originate.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.426","authors":["Tommaso Green","Simone Paolo Ponzetto","Goran Glava\u0161"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P2166","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.426.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76688/poster_document/ed37b6befdd9c1a9a39ac72af711db91.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76688/poster/87adf4ad66a797a5b3fc304fe5106c8d.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76688/slideshow/012062236594a4daecd48a7be9627027.pdf","title":"Massively Multilingual Lexical Specialization of Multilingual Transformers","tldr":"While pretrained language models (PLMs) primarily serve as general-purpose text encoders that can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks, recent work has shown that they can also be rewired to produce high-quality word representations (i.e., static word embeddings) and yield good perfo...","track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","underline_id":76688,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/posters/15237/poster/76688-tackling-modality-heterogeneity-with-multi-view-calibration-network-for-multimodal-sentiment-detection","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Language models (LMs) now excel at many tasks such as question answering, reasoning, and dialog.

When applied to the output of several state-of-the-art LMs on a diverse set of generation tasks, we find that RARR significantly improves attribution while otherwise preserving the original input to a much greater degree than previously explored edit models.

Unfortunately, lexical matching fails completely when a plausible candidate answer does not appear in the list of gold answers, which is increasingly the case as we shift from extractive to generative models. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical matching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making matching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-open, a popular benchmark. Our assessments reveal that while the true performance of all models is significantly underestimated, the performance of the InstructGPT (zero-shot) LLM increases by nearly +60\\%, making it on par with existing top models, and the InstructGPT (few-shot) model actually achieves a new state-of-the-art on NQ-open. We also find that more than 50\\% of lexical matching failures are attributed to semantically equivalent answers. We further demonstrate that regex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still suffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human evaluation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.307","authors":["Ehsan Kamalloo","Nouha Dziri","Charles Clarke","Davood Rafiei"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Resources and Evaluation","event_ids":["session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(oral)"],"id":"P2229","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.307.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76248/poster_document/3063e7a2e48836b731617f3b09b74783.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76248/poster/aa9e6553cd31069e1df2fdbaa25ab77c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76248/slideshow/d4e97b7ca2adaa561a7ee0b8934ecbc2.pdf","title":"Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models","tldr":"Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain question answering (QA).

Individual stories can be conceptualized as samples from an underlying mixture of competing narratives. The automated identification of these distinct narratives from unstructured text is a fundamental yet difficult task in Computational Linguistics since narratives are often  intertwined and only implicitly conveyed in text. In this paper, we consider a more feasible proxy task: Identify the distinct sets of aligned story actors responsible for sustaining the issue-specific narratives. Discovering aligned actors, and the groups these alignments create, brings us closer to estimating the narrative that each group represents. With the help of Large Language Models (LLM), we address this task by: (i) Introducing a corpus of text segments rich in narrative content associated with six different current  issues; (ii) Introducing a novel two-step graph-based framework that (a) identifies alignments between actors (INCANT) and (b) extracts aligned actor groups using the network structure (TAMPA). Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Existing works use the assumption that the target is known in advance, which is often not the case in the wild. Given a text from social media platforms, the target information is often unknown due to implicit mentions in the source text and it is infeasible to have manual target annotations at a large scale. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new task Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) that aims to extract the (target, stance) pair from the text. We benchmark the task by proposing a two-stage framework that first identifies the relevant target in the text and then detects the stance given the predicted target and text. Specifically, we first propose two different settings: Target Classification and Target Generation, to identify the potential target from a given text. Then we propose a multi-task approach that takes target prediction as the auxiliary task to detect the stance toward the predicted target. We evaluate the proposed framework on both in-target stance detection in which the test target is always seen in the training stage and zero-shot stance detection that needs to detect the stance for the targets that are unseen during the training phase. The new TSE task can facilitate future research in the field of stance detection.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.560","authors":["Yingjie Li","Krishna K Garg","Cornelia Caragea"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","event_ids":["session-2_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(oral)"],"id":"P2247","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.560.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76250/poster_document/54d3f09c3ce3ec03aed16299dc0afe20.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76250/poster/728896258ed1f96f36c623883438163c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A New Direction in Stance Detection: Target-Stance Extraction in the Wild","tldr":"Stance detection aims to detect the stance toward a corresponding target.

This benchmark will encourage research in developing more effective multilingual text simplification models and evaluation metrics. Our experiments using MultiSim with pre-trained multilingual language models reveal exciting performance improvements from multilingual training in non-English settings. We observe strong performance from Russian in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low-resource languages.

We find that the number of parameters alone does not explain hierarchical generalization: model depth plays greater role than model width.

In this work, we approach semantic parsing from, quite literally, the opposite direction; that is, we introduce a neural semantic parsing generation method that constructs logical forms from the bottom up, beginning from the logical form's leaves. The system we introduce is lazy in that it incrementally builds up a set of potential semantic parses, but only expands and processes the most promising candidate parses at each generation step. Such a parsimonious expansion scheme allows the system to maintain an arbitrarily large set of parse hypotheses that are never realized and thus incur minimal computational overhead.

However, it is unclear whether using multiple frames is beneficial to downstream tasks, and if yes, whether the performance gain is worth the drastically-increased computation and memory costs resulting from using more frames. In this work, we explore single-frame models for video-and-language learning. On a diverse set of video-and-language tasks (including text-to-video retrieval and video question answering), we show the surprising result that, with large-scale pre-training and a proper frame ensemble strategy at inference time, a single-frame trained model that does not consider temporal information can achieve better performance than existing methods that use multiple frames for training. This result reveals the existence of a strong ``static appearance bias'' in popular video-and-language datasets. Therefore, to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of video-and-language models, we propose two new retrieval tasks based on existing fine-grained action recognition datasets that encourage temporal modeling.

For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs' confidence in wrong predictions.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.75","authors":["Yangyi Chen","Lifan Yuan","Ganqu CUI","Zhiyuan Liu","Heng Ji"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P2396","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.75.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76717/poster_document/9764bc2dda2d300b4f578a9139e83795.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A Close Look into the Calibration of Pre-trained Language Models","tldr":"Pre-trained language models (PLMs) may fail in giving reliable estimates of their predictive uncertainty.

While rules are easily customizable and intuitive for humans to interpret, they are inherently fragile and lack the flexibility or robustness needed to moderate the vast amount of undesirable content found online today. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated the promise of using highly effective deep neural models to overcome these challenges. However, despite the improved performance, these data-driven models lack transparency and explainability, often leading to mistrust from everyday users and a lack of adoption by many platforms. In this paper, we present Rule By Example (RBE): a novel exemplar-based contrastive learning approach for learning from logical rules for the task of textual content moderation. RBE is capable of providing rule-grounded predictions, allowing for more explainable and customizable predictions compared to typical deep learning-based approaches. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning rich rule embedding representations using only a few data examples. Experimental results on 3 popular hate speech classification datasets show that RBE is able to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers as well as the use of rules in both supervised and unsupervised settings while providing explainable model predictions via rule-grounding.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.22","authors":["Christopher Clarke","Matthew Hall","Gaurav Mittal","Ye Yu","Sandra Sajeev","Jason Mars","Mei Chen"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"id":"P2401","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.22.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76718/poster_document/065bda69801c8815b0725a78b880a6ef.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76718/slideshow/83677b045dff0e7f94484b673d2ff92e.pdf","title":"Rule By Example: Harnessing Logical Rules for Explainable Hate Speech Detection","tldr":"Classic approaches to content moderation typically apply a rule-based heuristic approach to flag content.

We approach the problem with a mix of statistics-based quantization for the weights and elastic quantization of the activations and demonstrate the first ternary and binary transformer models on the downstream tasks of summarization and machine translation. Our ternary BART base achieves an R1 score of 41 on the CNN/DailyMail benchmark, which is merely 3.9 points behind the full model while being 16x more efficient. Our binary model, while less accurate, achieves a highly non-trivial score of 35.6. For machine translation, we achieved BLEU scores of 21.7 and 17.6 on the WMT16 En-Ro benchmark, compared with a full precision mBART model score of 26.8.

Recent empirical work and theoretical analysis with over-parameterized neural networks challenges the classic bias-variance trade-off notion suggesting that no such trade-off holds: as the width of the network grows, bias monotonically decreases while variance initially increases followed by a decrease. In this work, we first provide a variance decomposition-based justification criteria to examine whether large pretrained neural models in a fine-tuning setting are generalizable enough to have low bias and variance. We then perform theoretical and empirical analysis using ensemble methods explicitly designed to decrease variance due to optimization. This results in essentially a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm that first ratchets down bias and variance iteratively, and then uses a selected fixed-bias model to further reduce variance due to optimization by ensembling. We also analyze the nature of variance change with the ensemble size in low- and high-resource classes. Empirical results show that this two-stage method obtains strong results on SuperGLUE tasks and clinical information extraction tasks.

Furthermore, we propose a snowball local attention mechanism by leveraging the semantic similarity between two-hop neighbors to enrich the entity embedding. Finally, we use Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range dependence between entities to obtain richer representations with the global graph structure and entity features.

Previous methods utilizing pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performances, yet they show a lack of multimodal context reasoning capability, especially for text-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-modal Context  Reasoning approach, named ModCR. Compared to VLMs performing reasoning via cross modal semantic alignment, it regards the given textual abstract semantic and objective image information as the pre-context information and embeds them into the language model to perform context reasoning. Different from recent vision-aided language models used in natural language processing, ModCR incorporates the multi-view semantic alignment information between language and vision by introducing the learnable alignment prefix between image and text in the pretrained language model. This makes the language model well-suitable for such multi-modal reasoning scenario on joint textual and visual clues. We conduct extensive experiments on two corresponding data sets and experimental results show significantly improved performance (exact gain by 4.8\\% on PMR test set) compared to previous strong baselines.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.601","authors":["Yunxin Li","Baotian Hu","Chen Xinyu","Yuxin Ding","Lin Ma","Min Zhang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","event_ids":["session-7_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P2512","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.601.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76733/poster_document/064f3d65163c4b9295fc71ece2ab6477.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76733/slideshow/d6ec5dc2291f976893223a82f73116aa.pdf","title":"A Multi-Modal Context Reasoning Approach for Conditional Inference on Joint Textual and Visual Clues","tldr":"Conditional inference on joint textual and visual clues is a multi-modal reasoning task that textual clues provide prior permutation or external knowledge, which are complementary with visual content and pivotal to deducing the correct option.

The success of these methods is naturally attributed to the use of MPNNs over simpler multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, given their additional message passing (MP) component. In this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve comparable performance to MPNNs, suggesting that MP may not be as crucial as previously believed. With further exploration, we show careful scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC model performance. This suggests a conflation of scoring function design, loss function design, and MP in prior work, with promising insights regarding the scalability of state-of-the-art KGC methods today, as well as careful attention to more suitable MP designs for KGC tasks tomorrow.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.597","authors":["Juanhui Li","Harry Aaron Shomer","Jiayuan Ding","Yiqi Wang","Yao Ma","Neil Shah","Jiliang Tang","Dawei Yin"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P255","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.597.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76390/poster_document/899f9cfd3231b1441336e1940ab8833c.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Are Message Passing Neural Networks Really Helpful for Knowledge Graph Completion?","tldr":"Knowledge graphs (KGs) facilitate a wide variety of applications.

To address these two limitations, we propose a novel dual class knowledge propagation network in this paper. In order to learn well-separated representations for utterances with multiple intents, we first introduce a label-semantic augmentation module incorporating class name information. For better consideration of the inherent intra-class and inter-class relations, an instance-level and a class-level graph neural network are constructed, which not only propagate label information but also propagate feature structure.

In this work, we propose SCOTT, a faithful knowledge distillation method to learn a small, self-consistent CoT model from a teacher model that is orders of magnitude larger. To form better supervision, we elicit rationales supporting the gold answers from a large LM (teacher) by contrastive decoding, which encourages the teacher to generate tokens that become more plausible only when the answer is considered. To ensure faithful distillation, we use the teacher-generated rationales to learn a student LM with a counterfactual reasoning objective, which prevents the student from ignoring the rationales to make inconsistent predictions. Experiments show that while yielding comparable performance,  our method leads to a more faithful model than baselines. Further analysis shows that such a model respects the rationales more when making decisions; thus, we can improve its performance more by refining its rationales.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.304","authors":["Peifeng Wang","Zhengyang Wang","Zheng Li","Yifan Gao","Bing Yin","Xiang Ren"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-3_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(oral)"],"id":"P2622","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.304.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76266/poster_document/da3f4257237b9c742985f011dd214faa.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76266/poster/821d35c8161e54216ec5bc8025c5bf65.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"SCOTT: Self-Consistent Chain-of-Thought Distillation","tldr":"Large language models (LMs) beyond a certain scale, demonstrate the emergent capability of generating free-text rationales for their predictions via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.\nWhile CoT can yield dramatically improved performance, such gains are only observed for sufficiently large LMs. Even ...","track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","underline_id":76266,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/sessions/15222/lecture/76266-scott-self-consistent-chain-of-thought-distillation","video_url":null},{"abstract":"The retrieval model is an indispensable component for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks, e.g., open-domain question answering (ODQA).

ACLM alleviates the context-entity mismatch issue, a problem existing NER data augmentation techniques suffer from and often generates incoherent augmentations by placing complex named entities in the wrong context. ACLM builds on BART and is optimized on a novel text reconstruction or denoising task - we use selective masking (aided by attention maps) to retain the named entities and certain keywords in the input sentence that provide contextually relevant additional knowledge or hints about the named entities. Compared with other data augmentation strategies, ACLM can generate more diverse and coherent augmentations preserving the true word sense of complex entities in the sentence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLM both qualitatively and quantitatively on monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual complex NER across various low-resource settings. ACLM outperforms all our neural baselines by a significant margin (1\\%-36\\%). In addition, we demonstrate the application of ACLM to other domains that suffer from data scarcity (e.g., biomedical).

However, it is nontrivial to perform information extraction (IE) tasks with NL-LLMs since the output of the IE task is usually structured and therefore is hard to be converted into plain text.

In contrast to NL-LLMs, we show that Code-LLMs can be well-aligned with these IE tasks by designing code-style prompts and formulating these IE tasks as code generation tasks. Experiment results on seven benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms fine-tuning moderate-size pre-trained models specially designed for IE tasks (e.g., UIE) and prompting NL-LLMs under few-shot settings.

We identify input length thresholds (tipping points) at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory). To conduct this analysis for speech, we introduce L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model.

Previous methods achieve the promotion through fine-tuning PLMs. However, due to the data scarcity and the task gap, the pre-trained feature space cannot be accurately tuned to the task-specific space, which even aggravates the collapse of the vanilla space. Besides, the comprehension of hierarchical semantics for MIDRR makes the conversion much harder. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based Parameter-Efficient Multi-level IDRR (PEMI) framework to solve the above problems. First, we leverage parameter-efficient prompt tuning to drive the inputted arguments to match the pre-trained space and realize the approximation with few parameters. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical label refining (HLR) method for the prompt verbalizer to deeply integrate hierarchical guidance into the prompt tuning. Finally, our model achieves comparable results on PDTB 2.0 and 3.0 using about 0.1\\% trainable parameters compared with baselines and the visualization demonstrates the effectiveness of our HLR method.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.357","authors":["Haodong Zhao","Ruifang He","Mengnan Xiao","Jing Xu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Discourse and Pragmatics","event_ids":["poster-session-3_-discourse-and-pragmatics-(poster)"],"id":"P267","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.357.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76392/poster_document/5222974980849927935528851dbd7e1d.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76392/slideshow/42a25e139dc6330482e18a1e00d5f5c6.pdf","title":"Infusing Hierarchical Guidance into Prompt Tuning: A Parameter-Efficient Framework for Multi-level Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition","tldr":"Multi-level implicit discourse relation recognition (MIDRR) aims at identifying hierarchical discourse relations among arguments.

Based on that, we design a simple yet effective method: constructing moral discussions between simulated specific users and the dialogue system. The constructed discussions consist of expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views in dialogue exchanges, which makes conversational models learn morality well in a natural manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel evaluation method under the framework. We evaluate the multiple aspects of morality by judging the relation between dialogue responses and human values in discussions, where the multifaceted nature of morality is particularly considered.

Federated learning (FL) has merged as a promising technique for multiple participants to collaboratively train a shared model while efficiently protecting the sensitive data of participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work on applying FL to legal NLP. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first real-world FL benchmark for legal NLP, coined FEDLEGAL, which comprises five legal NLP tasks and one privacy task based on the data from Chinese courts.

Empirical results suggest that scale is not the only way, as novel algorithms can be a promising alternative.

However, existing dataset drift metrics in NLP have generally not considered specific dimensions of linguistic drift that affect model performance, and they have not been validated in their ability to predict model performance at the individual example level, where such metrics are often used in practice. In this paper, we propose three dimensions of linguistic dataset drift: vocabulary, structural, and semantic drift. These dimensions correspond to content word frequency divergences, syntactic divergences, and meaning changes not captured by word frequencies (e.g. lexical semantic change). We propose interpretable metrics for all three drift dimensions, and we modify past performance prediction methods to predict model performance at both the example and dataset level for English sentiment classification and natural language inference. We find that our drift metrics are more effective than previous metrics at predicting out-of-domain model accuracies (mean 16.8\\% root mean square error decrease), particularly when compared to popular fine-tuned embedding distances (mean 47.7\\% error decrease). Fine-tuned embedding distances are much more effective at ranking individual examples by expected performance, but decomposing into vocabulary, structural, and semantic drift produces the best example rankings of all considered model-agnostic drift metrics (mean 6.7\\% ROC AUC increase).","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.498","authors":["Tyler A Chang","Kishaloy Halder","Neha Anna John","Yogarshi Vyas","Yassine Benajiba","Miguel Ballesteros","Dan Roth"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P2755","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.498.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76770/poster_document/04fc8bd1d8aaf970091206ecfa8f8cdc.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76770/slideshow/8f6fad26e0ccb5c9f31e703c4eba988d.pdf","title":"Characterizing and Measuring Linguistic Dataset Drift","tldr":"NLP models often degrade in performance when real world data distributions differ markedly from training data.

However, it may suffer from the forgetting problem and the structural inconsistency between pretrained LMs and NMT models. Knowledge distillation (KD) may be a potential solution to alleviate these issues, but few studies have investigated language knowledge transfer from pretrained language models to NMT models through KD. In this paper, we propose Pretrained Bidirectional Distillation (PBD) for NMT, which aims to efficiently transfer bidirectional language knowledge from masked language pretraining to NMT models. Its advantages are reflected in efficiency and effectiveness through a globally defined and bidirectional context-aware distillation objective. Bidirectional language knowledge of the entire sequence is transferred to an NMT model concurrently during translation training. Specifically, we propose self-distilled masked language pretraining to obtain the PBD objective. We also design PBD losses to efficiently distill the language knowledge, in the form of token probabilities, to the encoder and decoder of an NMT model using the PBD objective. Extensive experiments reveal that pretrained bidirectional distillation can significantly improve machine translation performance and achieve competitive or even better results than previous pretrain-finetune or unified multilingual translation methods in supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot scenarios. Empirically, it is concluded that pretrained bidirectional distillation is an effective and efficient method for transferring language knowledge from pretrained language models to NMT models.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.63","authors":["Yimeng Zhuang","Mei Tu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-4_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P276","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.63.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76393/poster_document/bbdee7685050afec1bbdb3fe9e95ecbb.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Pretrained Bidirectional Distillation for Machine Translation","tldr":"Knowledge transfer can boost neural machine translation (NMT), for example, by finetuning a pretrained masked language model (LM).

The key idea of designing SynDG is to consider dialogue flow and coherence in the generation process. Specifically, given knowledge data, we first heuristically determine a dialogue flow, which is a series of knowledge pieces. Then, we employ T5 to incrementally turn the dialogue flow into a dialogue. To ensure coherence of both the dialogue flow and the synthetic dialogue, we design a two-level filtering strategy, at the flow-level and the utterance-level respectively.

All the modules are supervised by their corresponding labels separately, and the forward information flow is uni-directionally from the uni-modal modules to the multi-modal module. The supervision strategy and the model architecture guarantee each individual modality learns its representation independently, and meanwhile the multi-modal module aggregates all information.

In response, we present Token-Level Self-Evolution Training (SE), a simple and effective dynamic training method to fully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on dynamically learning the under-explored tokens for each forward pass and adaptively regularizes the training by introducing a novel token-specific label smoothing approach. Empirically, SE yields consistent and significant improvements in three tasks, i.e. machine translation, summarization, and grammatical error correction.

With the emergence of new entities and relations in constantly evolving KGs, inductive logical reasoning over KGs has become a crucial problem. However, previous PLMs-based methods struggle to model the logical structures of complex queries, which limits their ability to generalize within the same structure. In this paper, we propose a structure-modeled textual encoding framework for inductive logical reasoning over KGs. It encodes linearized query structures and entities using pre-trained language models to find answers. For structure modeling of complex queries, we design stepwise instructions that implicitly prompt PLMs on the execution order of geometric operations in each query.

In previous studies, attribute extraction is generally treated as a classification problem for predicting attribute types or a sequence tagging problem for labeling attribute values, where two paradigms, i.e., closed-world and open-world assumption, are involved. However, both of these paradigms have limitations in terms of real-world applications. And prior studies attempting to integrate these paradigms through ensemble, pipeline, and co-training models, still face challenges like cascading errors, high computational overhead, and difficulty in training. To address these existing problems, this paper presents Attribute Tree, a unified formulation for real-world attribute extraction application, where closed-world, open-world, and semi-open attribute extraction tasks are modeled uniformly. Then a text-to-tree generation model, AtTGen, is proposed to learn annotations from different scenarios efficiently and consistently.

Directly adopting existing hypergraph methods on clinical notes cannot sufficiently utilize the hierarchy information of the patient, which can degrade clinical semantic information by (1) frequent neutral words and (2) hierarchies with imbalanced distribution. Thus, we propose a taxonomy-aware multi-level hypergraph neural network (TM-HGNN), where multi-level hypergraphs assemble useful neutral words with rare keywords via note and taxonomy level hyperedges to retain the clinical semantic information. The constructed patient hypergraphs are fed into hierarchical message passing layers for learning more balanced multi-level knowledge at the note and taxonomy levels. We validate the effectiveness of TM-HGNN by conducting extensive experiments with MIMIC-III dataset on benchmark in-hospital-mortality prediction.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.305","authors":["Nayeon Kim","Yinhua Piao","Sun Kim"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["session-1_-nlp-applications-(oral)"],"id":"P2874","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.305.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76269/poster_document/10e14bbfc6ce0a2668928ed37cd5c819.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76269/poster/8a1222611f0b8c4d8b21513af02ad81c.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Clinical Note Owns its Hierarchy: Multi-Level Hypergraph Neural Networks for Patient-Level Representation Learning","tldr":"Leveraging knowledge from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict a patient's condition is essential to the effective delivery of appropriate care.

In this paper, we propose a unified debiasing framework Causal-Debias to remove unwanted stereotypical associations in PLMs during fine-tuning. Specifically, CausalDebias mitigates bias from a causal invariant perspective by leveraging the specific downstream task to identify bias-relevant and labelrelevant factors. We propose that bias-relevant factors are non-causal as they should have little impact on downstream tasks, while labelrelevant factors are causal. We perform interventions on non-causal factors in different demographic groups and design an invariant risk minimization loss to mitigate bias while maintaining task performance. Experimental results on three downstream tasks show that our proposed method can remarkably reduce unwanted stereotypical associations after PLMs are finetuned, while simultaneously minimizing the impact on PLMs and downstream applications.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.232","authors":["Fan Zhou","Yuzhou Mao","Liu Yu","Yi Yang","Ting Zhong"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Ethics and NLP","event_ids":["session-1_-ethics-and-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P2934","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.232.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76794/poster_document/ca44085faf78965a36107349fa1b6905.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76794/slideshow/bd474a2c3fd2f78bb047d45d10df1fe3.pdf","title":"Causal-Debias: Unifying Debiasing in Pretrained Language Models and Fine-tuning via Causal Invariant Learning","tldr":"Demographic biases and social stereotypes are common in pretrained language models (PLMs), and a burgeoning body of literature focuses on removing the unwanted stereotypical associations from PLMs. However, when fine-tuning these bias-mitigated PLMs in downstream natural language processing (NLP) ap...","track":"Ethics and NLP","underline_id":76794,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/posters/15200/poster/76794-causal-debias-unifying-debiasing-in-pretrained-language-models-and-fine-tuning-via-causal-invariant-learning","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Neural architecture search (NAS) has allowed for the automatic creation of new and effective neural network architectures, offering an alternative to the laborious process of manually designing complex architectures. However, traditional NAS algorithms are slow and require immense amounts of computing power. Recent research has investigated training-free NAS metrics for image classification architectures, drastically speeding up search algorithms. In this paper, we investigate training-free NAS metrics for recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT-based transformer architectures, targeted towards language modeling tasks. First, we develop a new training-free metric, named hidden covariance, that predicts the trained performance of an RNN architecture and significantly outperforms existing training-free metrics. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the hidden covariance metric on the NAS-Bench-NLP benchmark. Second, we find that the current search space paradigm for transformer architectures is not optimized for training-free neural architecture search. Instead, a simple qualitative analysis can effectively shrink the search space to the best performing architectures. This conclusion is based on our investigation of existing training-free metrics and new metrics developed from recent transformer pruning literature, evaluated on our own benchmark of trained BERT architectures. Ultimately, our analysis shows that the architecture search space and the training-free metric must be developed together in order to achieve effective results.

However, most existing efforts still focus on audio modality to improve robustness considering its dominance in AVSR task, with noise adaptation techniques such as front-end denoise processing. Though effective, these methods are usually faced with two practical challenges: 1) lack of sufficient labeled noisy audio-visual training data in some real-world scenarios and 2) less optimal model generality to unseen testing noises. In this work, we investigate the noise-invariant visual modality to strengthen robustness of AVSR, which can adapt to any testing noises while without dependence on noisy training data, a.k.a., unsupervised noise adaptation. Inspired by human perception mechanism, we propose a universal viseme-phoneme mapping (UniVPM) approach to implement modality transfer, which can restore clean audio from visual signals to enable speech recognition under any noisy conditions. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LRS3 and LRS2 show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art under various noisy as well as clean conditions. In addition, we also outperform previous state-of-the-arts on visual speech recognition task.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.848","authors":["Yuchen Hu","Ruizhe Li","Chen Chen","Chengwei Qin","Qiu-Shi Zhu","Eng Siong Chng"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Speech and Multimodality","event_ids":["session-7_-speech-and-multimodality-(oral)"],"id":"P2971","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.848.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76272/poster_document/07a8bf10243215df87c790b2a20e7903.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76272/poster/91333afcce89c9dc6b82d8bea9803015.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Hearing Lips in Noise: Universal Viseme-Phoneme Mapping and Transfer for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition","tldr":"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) provides a promising solution to ameliorate the noise-robustness of audio-only speech recognition with visual information.

In this paper, we find that the PLMs already possess the knowledge required to rebut such questions, and the key is how to activate the knowledge. To systematize this observation, we investigate the PLMs' responses to one kind of tricky questions, i.e., the false premises questions (FPQs). We annotate a FalseQA dataset containing 2365 human-written FPQs, with the corresponding explanations for the false premises and the revised true premise questions. Using FalseQA, we discover that PLMs are capable of discriminating FPQs by fine-tuning on moderate numbers (e.g., 256) of examples. PLMs also generate reasonable explanations for the false premise, which serve as rebuttals. Further replaying a few general questions during training allows PLMs to excel on FPQs and general questions simultaneously. Our work suggests that once the rebuttal ability is stimulated, knowledge inside the PLMs can be effectively utilized to handle FPQs, which incentivizes the research on PLM-based QA systems.

We find that the previous models generally consider binary type dependency scoring of a pair of instances, and leverage local search such as beam search to approximate global solutions. To better integrate cross-instance interactions, in this work, we introduce a joint IE framework (CRFIE) that formulates joint IE as a high-order Conditional Random Field. Specifically, we design binary factors and ternary factors to directly model interactions between not only a pair of instances but also triplets. Then, these factors are utilized to jointly predict labels of all instances.To address the intractability problem of exact high-order inference, we incorporate a high-order neural decoder that is unfolded from a mean-field variational inference method, which achieves consistent learning and inference. The experimental results show that our approach achieves consistent improvements on three IE tasks compared with our baseline and prior work.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.766","authors":["Zixia Jia","Zhaohui Yan","Wenjuan Han","Zilong Zheng","Kewei Tu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"id":"P3032","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.766.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76806/poster_document/3ad015099f5820ec096a23fdd90313af.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76806/slideshow/ce2e8d00934d7065d1c48f3591081999.pdf","title":"Modeling Instance Interactions for Joint Information Extraction with Neural High-Order Conditional Random Field","tldr":"Prior works on joint Information Extraction (IE) typically model instance (e.g., event triggers, entities, roles, relations) interactions by representation enhancement, type dependencies scoring, or global decoding.

Existing works mainly focus on fusing different features but ignore the challenge of modality heterogeneity. Specifically, different modalities with inherent disparities may bring three problems: 1) introducing redundant visual features during feature fusion; 2) causing feature shift in the representation space; 3) leading to inconsistent annotations for different modal data. All these issues will increase the difficulty in understanding the sentiment of the multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Calibration Network (MVCN) to alleviate the above issues systematically. We first propose a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to reduce the negative impacts of redundant visual elements. We then devise a sentiment-based congruity constraint task to calibrate the feature shift in the representation space. Finally, we introduce an adaptive loss calibration strategy to tackle inconsistent annotated labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of MVCN against previous approaches and achieve state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.287","authors":["yiwei wei","Shaozu Yuan","Ruosong Yang","Lei Shen","zhangmeizhi li","Longbiao Wang","Meng Chen"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","event_ids":["session-4_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3040","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.287.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76807/poster_document/9b8c832cfb1295d6fe2b7cccd9c80470.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Tackling Modality Heterogeneity with Multi-View Calibration Network for Multimodal Sentiment Detection","tldr":"With the popularity of social media, detecting sentiment from multimodal posts (e.g. image-text pairs) has attracted substantial attention recently.

recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models, these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks such as Winoground. We find that a critical component lacking from current vision-language models is relation-level alignment: the ability to match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., `mug in grass') with spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be enforced by encouraging the language attention from `mug' to `grass' (capturing the semantic relation `in') to match the visual attention from the mug to the grass (capturing the corresponding physical relation). Tokens and their corresponding objects are softly identified using a weighted mean of cross-modal attention. We prove that this notion of soft cross-modal equivalence is equivalent to enforcing congruence between vision and language attention matrices under a `change of basis' provided by the cross-modal attention matrix. Intuitively, our approach projects visual attention into the language attention space to calculate its divergence from the actual language attention, and vice versa. We apply our Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization (CACR) loss to fine-tune UNITER and improve its Winoground Group score by 5.75 points.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.298","authors":["Rohan Pandey","Rulin Shao","Paul Pu Liang","Ruslan Salakhutdinov","Louis-Philippe Morency"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(poster)"],"id":"P3065","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.298.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76812/poster_document/05b124e2aa2548746532a7f215d1c6d0.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76812/slideshow/5d980f13033d77206b5805935a0bf8bb.pdf","title":"Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization for Vision-Language Relation Alignment","tldr":"Despite recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models, these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks such as Winoground.

However, in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), message passing on a graph is independent from text, resulting in the graph representation hidden space differing from that of the text. This training regime of existing models therefore leads to a semantic gap between graph knowledge and text. In this study, we propose a novel framework for knowledge graph enhanced dialogue generation. We dynamically construct a multi-hop knowledge graph with pseudo nodes to involve the language model in feature aggregation within the graph at all steps. To avoid the semantic biases caused by learning on vanilla subgraphs, the proposed framework applies hierarchical graph attention to aggregate graph features on pseudo nodes and then attains a global feature. Therefore, the framework can better utilise the heterogeneous features from both the post and external graph knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on dialogue generation. Further analysis also shows that our representation learning framework can fill the semantic gap by coagulating representations of both text and graph knowledge. Moreover, the language model also learns how to better select knowledge triples for a more informative response via exploiting subgraph patterns within our feature aggregation process.

However, where the knowledge hides in KD is still not clear, which may hinder the development of KD. In this work, we first unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly, the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1 information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To address these issues, we propose a new method named Top-1 Information Enhanced Knowledge Distillation (TIE-KD). Specifically, we design a hierarchical ranking loss to enforce the learning of the top-1 information from the teacher. Additionally, we develop an iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the data without ground-truth targets. Experiments on WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 English-Romanian demonstrate that our method can respectively boost Transformer$_{base}$ students by +1.04, +0.60 and +1.11 BLEU scores and significantly outperforms the vanilla word-level KD baseline.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods use the cross-encoder (CE) based architecture. CE concatenates a mention (and its context) with each type and feeds the pair into a pretrained language model (PLM) to score their relevance. It brings deeper interaction between the mention and the type to reach better performance but has to perform $N$ (the type set size) forward passes to infer all the types of a single mention. CE is therefore very slow in inference when the type set is large (e.g., $N=10k$ for UFET). \n\\% Cross-encoder also ignores the correlation between different types.\nTo this end, we propose to perform entity typing in a recall-expand-filter manner.

There is a critical need for high-quality resources for multi-document NFQA (MD-NFQA) to train new models and evaluate answers' grounding and factual consistency in relation to supporting documents.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce WikiHowQA, a new multi-document NFQA benchmark built on WikiHow, a website dedicated to answering ``how-to'' questions. The benchmark includes 11,746 human-written answers along with 74,527 supporting documents. We describe the unique challenges of the resource, provide strong baselines, and propose a novel human evaluation framework that utilizes highlighted relevant supporting passages to mitigate issues such as assessor unfamiliarity with the question topic.

To account for sociodemographics in models of individual annotator behaviour, we introduce group-specific layers to multi-annotator models.

In this paper, we explored the issue of how the prototypicality of event participants affects the ability of Language Models (LMs) to handle elliptical sentences and to identify the omitted arguments at different degrees of thematic fit, ranging from highly typical participants to semantically anomalous ones. With this purpose in mind, we built ELLie, the first dataset composed entirely of utterances containing different types of elliptical constructions, and structurally suited for evaluating the effect of argument thematic fit in solving ellipsis and reconstructing the missing element. Our tests demonstrated that the probability scores assigned by the models are higher for typical events than for atypical and impossible ones in different elliptical contexts, confirming the influence of prototypicality of the event participants in interpreting such linguistic structures. Finally, we conducted a retrieval task of the elided verb in the sentence in which the low performance of LMs highlighted a considerable difficulty in reconstructing the correct event.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.188","authors":["Davide Testa","Emmanuele Chersoni","Alessandro Lenci"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Resources and Evaluation","event_ids":["session-1_-resources-and-evaluation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3179","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.188.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76830/poster_document/d65ffd2aeec20f02e2f328f1192dba73.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"We Understand Elliptical Sentences, and Language Models should Too: A New Dataset for Studying Ellipsis and its Interaction with Thematic Fit","tldr":"Ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon characterized by the omission of one or more sentence elements.

Most recent approaches usually involve two steps: (1) modeling entity interactions; (2) decoding entity interactions into events. However, such approaches ignore a global view of inter-dependency of multiple events. Moreover, an event is decoded by iteratively merging its related entities as arguments, which might suffer from error propagation and is computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for document-level multi-event extraction with event proxy nodes and Hausdorff distance minimization. The event proxy nodes, representing pseudo-events, are able to build connections with other event proxy nodes, essentially capturing global information. The Hausdorff distance makes it possible to compare the similarity between the set of predicted events and the set of ground-truth events. By directly minimizing Hausdorff distance, the model is trained towards the global optimum directly, which improves performance and reduces training time.

In this work, we introduce a new task of Stylized Visual Storytelling (SVST), which aims to describe a photo stream with stylized stories that are more expressive and attractive. We propose a multitasking memory-augmented framework called StyleVSG, which is jointly trained on factual visual storytelling data and unpaired style corpus, achieving a trade-off between style accuracy and visual relevance. Particularly for unpaired stylized text, StyleVSG learns to reconstruct the stylistic story from roughly parallel visual inputs mined with the CLIP model, avoiding problems caused by random mapping in previous methods. Furthermore, a memory module is designed to preserve the consistency and coherence of generated stories. Experiments show that our method can generate attractive and coherent stories with different styles such as fairy tale, romance, and humor.

Recent studies of the human evaluation community show that considering both major errors (e.g. mistranslated tokens) and minor errors (e.g. imperfections in fluency) can produce high-quality judgments. This inspires us to approach the final goal of the automatic metrics (human-like evaluations) by fine-grained error analysis. In this paper, we argue that the ability to estimate sentence confidence is the tip of the iceberg for PLM-based metrics. And it can be used to refine the generated sentence toward higher confidence and more reference-grounded, where the costs of refining and approaching reference are used to determine the major and minor errors, respectively.\nTo this end, we take BARTScore as the testbed and present an innovative solution to marry the unexploited sentence refining capacity of BARTScore and human-like error analysis, where the final score consists of both the evaluations of major and minor errors. Experiments show that our solution consistently and significantly improves BARTScore, and outperforms top-scoring metrics in 19/25 test settings.

In this paper, we revisit the setup of these approaches and find that the benefits brought by these approaches are significantly overestimated. Specifically, we find that the success of existing weakly supervised learning approaches heavily relies on the availability of clean validation samples which, as we show, can be leveraged much more efficiently by simply training on them. After using these clean labels in training, the advantages of using these sophisticated approaches are mostly wiped out. This remains true even when reducing the size of the available clean data to just five samples per class, making these approaches impractical.

Although methods based on parameter efficient tuning like prefix-tuning could achieve multi-aspect controlling in a plug-and-play way, the mutual interference of multiple prefixes leads to significant degeneration of constraints and limits their extensibility to training-time unseen aspect combinations. In this work, we provide a theoretical lower bound for the interference and empirically found that the interference grows with the number of layers where prefixes are inserted. Based on these analyses, we propose using trainable gates to normalize the intervention of prefixes to restrain the growing interference. As a result, controlling training-time unseen combinations of aspects can be realized by simply concatenating corresponding plugins such that new constraints can be extended at a lower cost. In addition, we propose a unified way to process both categorical and free-form constraints.

Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism.

Without such patterns, models poorly generalize and prefer responding safely. Many attempts have been made in either multi-turn settings from a one-to-many perspective or in a many-to-many perspective but limited to single-turn settings. The major challenge to many-to-many augment multi-turn dialogues is that discretely replacing each turn with semantic similarity breaks fragile context coherence. In this paper, we propose DialoGue Path Sampling (DialoGPS) method in continuous semantic space, the first many-to-many augmentation method for multi-turn dialogues.

Recently, kNN-MT has provided an effective paradigm to smooth the prediction based on neighbor representations during inference.

We propose an effective training framework INK to directly smooth the representation space via adjusting representations of kNN neighbors with a small number of new parameters. The new parameters are then used to refresh the whole representation datastore to get new kNN knowledge asynchronously. This loop keeps running until convergence.

Mainstream techniques are based on a dual-encoder framework, which encodes mentions and entities independently and calculates their relevances via rough interaction metrics, resulting in difficulty in explicitly modeling multiple mention-relevant parts within entities to match divergent mentions. Aiming at learning entity representations that can match divergent mentions, this paper proposes a Multi-View Enhanced Distillation (MVD) framework, which can effectively transfer knowledge of multiple fine-grained and mention-relevant parts within entities from cross-encoders to dual-encoders. Each entity is split into multiple views to avoid irrelevant information being over-squashed into the mention-relevant view. We further design cross-alignment and self-alignment mechanisms for this framework to facilitate fine-grained knowledge distillation from the teacher model to the student model. Meanwhile, we reserve a global-view that embeds the entity as a whole to prevent dispersal of uniform information.

In previous works, it is difficult to accurately rank the quality of speech when the MOS scores are close. However, in practical applications, it is more important to correctly rank the quality of synthesis systems or sentences than simply predicting MOS scores. Meanwhile, as each annotator scores multiple audios during annotation, the score is probably a relative value based on the first or the first few speech scores given by the annotator. \nMotivated by the above two points, we propose a general framework for MOS prediction based on pair comparison (MOSPC), and we utilize C-Mixup algorithm to enhance the generalization performance of MOSPC.\nThe experiments on BVCC and VCC2018 show that our framework outperforms the baselines on most of the correlation coefficient metrics, especially on the metric KTAU related to quality ranking.

Yet, only a handful of past studies have explored ICL in a cross-lingual setting, in which the need for transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap, we provide the first in-depth analysis of ICL for cross-lingual text classification. We find that the prevalent mode of selecting random input-label pairs to construct the prompt-context is severely limited in the case of cross-lingual ICL, primarily due to the lack of alignment in the input as well as the output spaces. To mitigate this, we propose a novel prompt construction strategy --- Cross-lingual In-context Source Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an injected coherence in the semantics of the input examples and a task-based alignment across the source and target languages, X-InSTA is able to outperform random prompt selection by a large margin across three different tasks using 44 different cross-lingual pairs.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.346","authors":["Eshaan Tanwar","Subhabrata Dutta","Manish Borthakur","Tanmoy Chakraborty"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-4_-large-language-models-(oral)"],"id":"P3259","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.346.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76285/poster_document/ef6a25ea8b69cc7c839ceffc6c391ed4.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76285/poster/ebeb7513049b465c4b6c05cee9ce419e.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Multilingual LLMs are Better Cross-lingual In-context Learners with Alignment","tldr":"In-context learning (ICL) unfolds as large language models become capable of inferring test labels conditioned on a few labeled samples without any gradient update.

Unfortunately, for low-resource languages, such as minority languages, regional languages or dialects, ASR performance generally remains much lower. In this study, we investigate whether data augmentation techniques could help improve low-resource ASR performance, focusing on four typologically diverse minority languages or language variants (West Germanic: Gronings, West-Frisian; Malayo-Polynesian: Besemah, Nasal). For all four languages, we examine the use of self-training, where an ASR system trained with the available human-transcribed data is used to generate transcriptions, which are then combined with the original data to train a new ASR system. For Gronings, for which there was a pre-existing text-to-speech (TTS) system available, we also examined the use of TTS to generate ASR training data from text-only sources. We find that using a self-training approach consistently yields improved performance (a relative WER reduction up to 20.5\\% compared to using an ASR system trained on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). The performance gain from TTS augmentation for Gronings was even stronger (up to 25.5\\% relative reduction in WER compared to a system based on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). In sum, our results show the benefit of using self-training or (if possible) TTS-generated data as an efficient solution to overcome the limitations of data availability for resource-scarce languages in order to improve ASR performance.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.42","authors":["Martijn Bartelds","Nay San","Bradley McDonnell","Dan Jurafsky","Martijn Wieling"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Speech and Multimodality","event_ids":["session-7_-speech-and-multimodality-(oral)"],"id":"P3291","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.42.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76287/poster_document/e86f3ac2d0b252e558e0ad82aec89ef7.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76287/poster/82298d0348da72f3b777192c6072f425.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Making More of Little Data: Improving Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition Using Data Augmentation","tldr":"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has advanced substantially in recent years, particularly for languages for which a large amount of transcribed speech is available.

(ii) To complete the assumption of a follow-up action chain, we design a novel symbolic module that can complete strict derivation of the progressive action chain layer by layer.

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) bring the opportunity to leverage textual data, such as earnings reports of publicly traded companies, to predict the return rate for an asset. However, when dealing with such a sensitive task, the consistency of models -- their invariance under meaning-preserving alternations in input -- is a crucial property for building user trust. Despite this, current methods for financial forecasting do not take consistency into consideration.

Using FinTrust, we show that the consistency of state-of-the-art NLP models for financial forecasting is poor.

Our hypothesis is that the insensitivity can be attributed to the weight sum operation utilized in the attention module. To verify this hypothesis, we propose a novel weight concatenation operation and evaluate its efficacy in neural machine translation tasks.

However, creating high-quality datasets with LLMs can be challenging. In this work, we explore human-AI partnerships to facilitate high diversity and accuracy in LLM-based text data generation. We first examine two approaches to diversify text generation: 1) logit suppression, which minimizes the generation of languages that have already been frequently generated, and 2) temperature sampling, which flattens the token sampling probability. We found that diversification approaches can increase data diversity but often at the cost of data accuracy (i.e., text and labels being appropriate for the target domain). To address this issue, we examined two human interventions, 1) label replacement (LR), correcting misaligned labels, and 2) out-of-scope filtering (OOSF), removing instances that are out of the user's domain of interest or to which no considered label applies. With oracle studies, we found that LR increases the absolute accuracy of models trained with diversified datasets by 14.4\\%. Moreover, we found that some models trained with data generated with LR interventions outperformed LLM-based few-shot classification. In contrast, OOSF was not effective in increasing model accuracy, implying the need for future work in human-in-the-loop text data generation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.34","authors":["John Joon Young Chung","Ece Kamar","Saleema Amershi"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-5_-generation-(oral)"],"id":"P3438","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.34.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76294/poster_document/6d0a0d5080e79d7754b1261341189c50.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76294/poster/882d4cbd1a1c4c42a1977cb4302d2688.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Increasing Diversity While Maintaining Accuracy: Text Data Generation with Large Language Models and Human Interventions","tldr":"Large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate text data for training and evaluating other models.

These models incrementally process a long document from left to right and extract relations between mentions and entities in a cache, resulting in much lower memory and computation cost compared to computing all mentions in parallel. However, they do not handle cache misses when high-quality entities are purged from the cache, which causes wrong assignments and leads to prediction errors. We propose a new hybrid cache that integrates two eviction policies to capture global and local entities separately, and effectively reduces the aggregated cache misses up to half as before, while improving F1 score of coreference by 0.7~5.7pt. As such, the hybrid policy can accelerate existing cache-based models and offer a new long document coreference resolution solution.

To produce a parse tree, we use chart parsing to find the tree with the minimum score. Our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on English with masked LMs, and also demonstrates superior performance in a multilingual setting, outperforming the state-of-the-art in 6 out of 8 languages. Notably, although our method does not involve parameter updates or extensive hyperparameter search, its performance can even surpass some unsupervised parsing methods that require fine-tuning. Our analysis highlights that the distortion of contextual representation resulting from syntactic perturbation can serve as an effective indicator of constituency across languages.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.285","authors":["Jiaxi Li","Wei Lu"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing","event_ids":["session-2_-syntax_-tagging,-chunking,-and-parsing-(oral)"],"id":"P3454","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.285.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76296/poster_document/a1724d995336b2778210d17e8306a6b6.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76296/poster/1ff274447d9423152bbf2316fa1f2944.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Contextual Distortion Reveals Constituency: Masked Language Models are Implicit Parsers","tldr":"Recent advancements in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated that these models possess some degree of syntactic awareness.

Specifically, most of the well-performed metrics are required to train on evaluation datasets of specific NLG tasks and evaluation dimensions, which may cause over-fitting to task-specific datasets. Furthermore, existing metrics only provide an evaluation score for each dimension without revealing the evidence to interpret how this score is obtained. To deal with these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective metric called DecompEval. This metric formulates NLG evaluation as an instruction-style question answering task and utilizes instruction-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) without training on evaluation datasets, aiming to enhance the generalization ability. To make the evaluation process more interpretable, we decompose our devised instruction-style question about the quality of generated texts into the subquestions that measure the quality of each sentence. The subquestions with their answers generated by PLMs are then recomposed as evidence to obtain the evaluation result. Experimental results show that DecompEval achieves state-of-the-art performance in untrained metrics for evaluating text summarization and dialogue generation, which also exhibits strong dimension-level / task-level generalization ability and interpretability.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.539","authors":["Pei Ke","Fei Huang","Fei Mi","Yasheng Wang","Qun Liu","Xiaoyan Zhu","Minlie Huang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3458","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.539.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76870/poster_document/5c6fb70c65f056577803e3610d89a320.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76870/slideshow/aa29061d2d9fc2516237206139d81f34.pdf","title":"DecompEval: Evaluating Generated Texts as Unsupervised Decomposed Question Answering","tldr":"Existing evaluation metrics for natural language generation (NLG) tasks face the challenges on generalization ability and interpretability.

This has led to several attempts to counteract this phenomenon both on static and contextualized text representations. However, despite this effort, there is no established relationship between anisotropy and performance. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the impact of different transformations on both the isotropy and the performance in order to assess the true impact of anisotropy. To this end, we rely on the clustering task as a means of evaluating the ability of text representations to produce meaningful groups. Thereby, we empirically show a limited impact of anisotropy on the expressiveness of sentence representations both in terms of directions and L2 closeness.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.103","authors":["Mira Ait-Saada","Mohamed Nadif"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Theme: Reality Check","event_ids":["session-7_-theme_-reality-check-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3472","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.103.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76872/poster_document/7cd8668c8ec24b9914d056fcf262a88d.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Is Anisotropy Truly Harmful?

However, for fact verification, KGs have not been adequately utilized as a knowledge source. KGs can be a valuable knowledge source in fact verification due to their reliability and broad applicability. A KG consists of nodes and edges which makes it clear how concepts are linked together, allowing machines to reason over chains of topics. However, there are many challenges in understanding how these machine-readable concepts map to information in text. To enable the community to better use KGs, we introduce a new dataset, FactKG: Fact Verification\nvia Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs. It consists of 108k natural language claims with five types of reasoning: One-hop, Conjunction, Existence, Multi-hop, and Negation.

While existing benchmarks measure the correlation with human judgements of faithfulness on model-generated summaries, they are insufficient for diagnosing whether metrics are: 1) consistent, i.e., indicate lower faithfulness as errors are introduced into a summary, 2) effective on human-written texts, and 3) sensitive to different error types (as summaries can contain multiple errors). To address these needs, we present a benchmark of unfaithful minimal pairs (BUMP), a dataset of 889 human-written, minimally different summary pairs, where a single error is introduced to a summary from the CNN/DailyMail dataset to produce an unfaithful summary. We find BUMP complements existing benchmarks in a number of ways: 1) the summaries in BUMP are harder to discriminate and less probable under SOTA summarization models, 2) unlike non-pair-based datasets, BUMP can be used to measure the consistency of metrics, and reveals that the most discriminative metrics tend not to be the most consistent, and 3) unlike datasets containing generated summaries with multiple errors, BUMP enables the measurement of metrics' performance on individual error types.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.716","authors":["Liang Ma","Shuyang Cao","Robert L Logan IV","Di Lu","Shihao Ran","Ke Zhang","Joel Tetreault","Alejandro Jaimes"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Resources and Evaluation","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(poster)"],"id":"P3495","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.716.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76876/poster_document/099403119db09ad224b58ac2e8a94093.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76876/slideshow/84faeb45cf51a385960e3a4e7a61d7fd.pdf","title":"BUMP: A Benchmark of Unfaithful Minimal Pairs for Meta-Evaluation of Faithfulness Metrics","tldr":"The proliferation of automatic faithfulness metrics for summarization has produced a need for benchmarks to evaluate them.

However, this heuristic potentially ignores the valuable context encoded by the embeddings. In this work, we present a contrastive solution that learns to select the most useful embeddings for expansion. More specifically, a deep language model-based contrastive weighting model, called CWPRF, is trained to learn to discriminate between relevant and non-relevant documents for semantic search. Our experimental results show that our contrastive weighting model can aid to select useful expansion embeddings and outperform various baselines. In particular, CWPRF can improve nDCG@10 by upto to 4.1\\% compared to an existing PRF approach for ColBERT while maintaining its efficiency.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.710","authors":["Xiao Wang","Sean MacAvaney","Craig Macdonald","Iadh Ounis"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Retrieval and Text Mining","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-information-retrieval-and-text-mining-(poster)"],"id":"P3549","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.710.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76886/poster_document/d7bcac22a56af864ca28c8f7a5bf14aa.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Effective Contrastive Weighting for Dense Query Expansion","tldr":"Verbatim queries submitted to search engines often do not sufficiently describe the user's search intent.

To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning.

Indeed, supporting arguments with narratives or personal experiences (henceforth, stories) is a very natural thing to do -- and yet, this phenomenon is largely unexplored in computational argumentation. Which role do stories play in an argument? Do they make the argument more effective? What are their narrative properties? To address these questions, we collected and annotated StoryARG, a dataset sampled from well-established corpora in computational argumentation (ChangeMyView and RegulationRoom), and the Social Sciences (Europolis), as well as comments to New York Times articles. StoryARG contains 2451 textual spans annotated at two levels.

Semantic underspecification is not a bug but a crucial language feature that boosts its storage and processing efficiency. Indeed, human speakers can quickly and effortlessly integrate semantically-underspecified linguistic signals with a wide range of non-linguistic information, e.g., the multimodal context, social or cultural conventions, and shared knowledge. Standard NLP models have, in principle, no or limited access to such extra information, while multimodal systems grounding language into other modalities, such as vision, are naturally equipped to account for this phenomenon. However, we show that they struggle with it, which could negatively affect their performance and lead to harmful consequences when used for applications.

Furthermore, we introduce a fusion mechanism to model the multi-directional interactions through which CMIN learns not only the self-influence but also the interactive influence in information flows representing the interrelationship between text and stock correlations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experiments on three real-world datasets collected from the U.S. and Chinese markets, where CMIN outperforms existing models to establish a new state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.679","authors":["Di Luo","Weiheng Liao","Shuqi Li","Xin Cheng","Rui Yan"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["session-4_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3625","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.679.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76892/poster_document/e16923fd9a2d5e5831eadd681180d7bc.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76892/slideshow/a83697585ad71d854f8df7cb589cdf5f.pdf","title":"Causality-Guided Multi-Memory Interaction Network for Multivariate Stock Price Movement Prediction","tldr":"Over the past few years, we've witnessed an enormous interest in stock price movement prediction using AI techniques.

However, it is unclear how well models that are trained on this 20-year-old data and developed over a period of decades using the same test set will perform when applied on modern data. In this paper, we evaluate the generalization of over 20 different models trained on CoNLL-2003, and show that NER models have very different generalization. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of performance degradation in pre-trained Transformers, such as RoBERTa and T5, even when fine-tuned using decades-old data. We investigate why some models generalize well to new data while others do not, and attempt to disentangle the effects of temporal drift and overfitting due to test reuse. Our analysis suggests that most deterioration is due to temporal mismatch between the pre-training corpora and the downstream test sets. We found that four factors are important for good generalization: model architecture, number of parameters, time period of the pre-training corpus, in addition to the amount of fine-tuning data.

However, evaluations of these attacks ignore the property of imperceptibility or study it under limited settings. This entails that adversarial perturbations would not pass any human quality gate and do not represent real threats to human-checked NLP systems. To bypass this limitation and enable proper assessment (and later, improvement) of NLP model robustness, we have surveyed 378 human participants about the perceptibility of text adversarial examples produced by state-of-the-art methods. Our results underline that existing text attacks are impractical in real-world scenarios where humans are involved. This contrasts with previous smaller-scale human studies, which reported overly optimistic conclusions regarding attack success. Through our work, we hope to position human perceptibility as a first-class success criterion for text attacks, and provide guidance for research to build effective attack algorithms and, in turn, design appropriate defence mechanisms.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.491","authors":["Salijona Dyrmishi","Salah GHAMIZI","Maxime Cordy"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Theme: Reality Check","event_ids":["session-7_-theme_-reality-check-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3734","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.491.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76911/poster_document/3a4e93ac871d8fbdaabf92a19ed7d455.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76911/poster/84be8f31d39306b9895d5b41c8406bf4.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"How do humans perceive adversarial text?

Our method improves the performance of SLT in the gloss-free setting by exploiting the shared underlying semantics of signs and the corresponding spoken translation. Common concepts are extracted from the text and used as a weak form of intermediate representation. The global embedding of these concepts is used as a query for cross-attention to find the corresponding information within the learned visual features. In a contrastive manner, we encourage the similarity of query results between samples containing such concepts and decrease those that do not.

Our best syntactic evaluation datasets, however, provide substantially less linguistic context than models receive during pretraining. This mismatch raises an important question: how robust are models' syntactic judgements across different contexts? In this paper, we vary the input contexts based on: length, the types of syntactic phenomena it contains, and whether or not there are grammatical violations. We find that model judgements are generally robust when placed in randomly sampled linguistic contexts, but are unstable when contexts match the test stimuli in syntactic structure. Among all tested models (GPT-2 and five variants of OPT), we find that model performance is affected when we provided contexts with matching syntactic structure: performance significantly improves when contexts are acceptable, and it significantly declines when they are unacceptable. This effect is amplified by the length of the context, except for unrelated inputs. We show that these changes in model performance are not explainable by acceptability-preserving syntactic perturbations. This sensitivity to highly specific syntactic features of the context can only be explained by the models' implicit in-context learning abilities.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.333","authors":["Koustuv Sinha","Jon Gauthier","Aaron Mueller","Kanishka Misra","Keren Fuentes","Roger Levy","Adina Williams"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P3760","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.333.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76915/poster_document/3b2e699f11ac711882bd165edebb24d0.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76915/poster/b9f69481a972b1403b26d12e6d387410.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76915/slideshow/c252384842a43d7dda5a9fe67f36d1c7.pptx","title":"Language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context","tldr":"Targeted syntactic evaluations of language models ask whether models show stable preferences for syntactically acceptable content over minimal-pair unacceptable inputs.

However, there is a crucial lack of annotated meeting corpora for developing this technology, as it can be hard to collect meetings, especially when the topics discussed are confidential. Furthermore, meeting summaries written by experienced writers are scarce, making it hard for abstractive summarizers to produce sensible output without a reliable reference. This lack of annotated corpora has hindered the development of meeting summarization technology. In this paper, we present MeetingBank, a new benchmark dataset of city council meetings over the past decade. MeetingBank is unique among other meeting corpora due to its divide-and-conquer approach, which involves dividing professionally written meeting minutes into shorter passages and aligning them with specific segments of the meeting.

While many studies discuss these design choices, there have been few systematic investigations into categorizing them and mitigating their impact. In this work, we define a typology for three types of label biases in ICL for text classification: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias (which we conceptualize and detect for the first time). \n\nOur analysis demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fall short of addressing all three types of biases. Specifically, domain-label bias restricts LLMs to random-level performance on many tasks regardless of the choice of in-context examples.  To mitigate the effect of these biases, we propose a simple bias calibration method that estimates a language model's label bias using random in-domain words from the task corpus. After controlling for this estimated bias when making predictions, our novel domain-context calibration significantly improves the ICL performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 on a wide range of tasks. The gain is substantial on tasks with large domain-label bias (up to 37\\% in Macro-F1). Furthermore, our results generalize to models with different scales, pretraining methods, and manually-designed task instructions, showing the prevalence of label biases in ICL.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.783","authors":["Yu Fei","Yifan Hou","Zeming Chen","Antoine Bosselut"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P3786","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.783.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76922/poster_document/6b5fd004d77153cb77400f9f625472eb.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76922/poster/2656b295831ad02979181c8925f4245a.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Mitigating Label Biases for In-context Learning","tldr":"Various design settings for in-context learning (ICL), such as the choice and order of the in-context examples, can bias the model's predictions.

However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs' representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

However, existing human evaluation studies for summarization either exhibit a low inter-annotator agreement or have insufficient scale, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is lacking. Therefore, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization evaluation along the following axes: (1) We propose a modified summarization salience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which is based on fine-grained semantic units and allows for a high inter-annotator agreement. (2) We curate the Robust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation dataset consisting of 22,000 summary-level annotations over 28 top-performing systems on three datasets. (3) We conduct a comparative study of four human evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in evaluation setups. (4) We evaluate 50 automatic metrics and their variants using the collected human annotations across evaluation protocols and demonstrate how our benchmark leads to more statistically stable and significant results. The metrics we benchmarked include recent methods based on large language models (LLMs), GPTScore and G-Eval. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating LLMs, as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g., GPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the annotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust, targeted evaluation methods.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.228","authors":["Yixin Liu","Alex Fabbri","Pengfei Liu","Yilun Zhao","Linyong Nan","Ruilin Han","Simeng Han","Shafiq Joty","Chien-Sheng Jason Wu","Caiming Xiong","Dragomir Radev"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Summarization","event_ids":["session-4_-summarization-(oral)"],"id":"P3833","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.228.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76307/poster_document/a248b58b8baef679016b484448471b46.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76307/poster/29a2f1db6f7a9a3858116b55de435c39.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Revisiting the Gold Standard: Grounding Summarization Evaluation with Robust Human Evaluation","tldr":"Human evaluation is the foundation upon which the evaluation of both summarization systems and automatic metrics rests.

We study various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METRO-T0, which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies and then prompt-finetuned on a mixture of NLP tasks.

In response, the MT community has, in part, shifted its focus to document-level translation. Translating documents requires a deeper understanding of the structure and meaning of text, which is often captured by various kinds of discourse phenomena such as consistency, coherence, and cohesion. However, this renders conventional sentence-level MT evaluation benchmarks inadequate for evaluating the performance of context-aware MT systems. This paper\npresents a new dataset with rich discourse annotations, built upon the large-scale parallel corpus BWB introduced in Jiang et al. (2022a). The new BWB annotation introduces four extra evaluation aspects, i.e., entity, terminology, coreference, and quotation, covering 15,095 entity mentions in both languages. Using these annotations, we systematically investigate the similarities and differences between the discourse structures of source and target languages, and the challenges they pose to MT. We discover that MT outputs differ fundamentally from human translations in terms of their latent discourse structures. This gives us a new perspective on the challenges and opportunities in document-level MT. We make our resource publicly available to spur future research in document-level MT and its generalization to other language translation tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.435","authors":["Yuchen Eleanor Jiang","Tianyu Liu","Shuming Ma","Dongdong Zhang","Mrinmaya Sachan","Ryan Cotterell"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-2_-machine-translation-(oral)"],"id":"P3890","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.435.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76310/poster/0ea4999ceec3dc99e44e54d261d8d950.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Discourse-Centric Evaluation of Document-level Machine Translation with a New Densely Annotated Parallel Corpus of Novels","tldr":"Several recent papers claim to have achieved human parity at sentence-level machine translation (MT)\u2014especially between high-resource language pairs.

We use this task to first investigate whether Flan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only GPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit this ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking.

Multi-exit is a mainstream approach to address this issue by making a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, where the saving of computation comes from an early exit. However, whether such saving from early-exiting is robust remains unknown. Motivated by this, we first show that directly adapting existing adversarial attack approaches targeting model accuracy cannot significantly reduce inference efficiency. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective attacking framework, SAME, a novel slowdown attack framework on multi-exit models, which is specially tailored to reduce the efficiency of the multi-exit models. By leveraging the multi-exit models' design characteristics, we utilize all internal predictions to guide the adversarial sample generation instead of merely considering the final prediction. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that SAME can effectively diminish the efficiency gain of various multi-exit models by 80\\% on average, convincingly validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.395","authors":["Yiming Chen","Simin Chen","Zexin Li","Wei Yang","Cong Liu","Robby Tan","Haizhou Li"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P3939","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.395.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76941/poster_document/d139014bc21d051a4c30ab2e8d02add8.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76941/poster/bc52a34b558c0684e9b4d12bb4893616.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Dynamic Transformers Provide a False Sense of Efficiency","tldr":"Despite much success in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained language models typically lead to a high computational cost during inference.

Task-oriented dialogue systems use task schema, which is a set of task attributes, to encode the user's task goals. Existing studies on USM neglect explicitly modeling the user's task goals fulfillment using the task schema. In this paper, we propose SG-USM, a novel schema-guided user satisfaction modeling framework. It explicitly models the degree to which the user's preferences regarding the task attributes are fulfilled by the system for predicting the user's satisfaction level. SG-USM employs a pre-trained language model for encoding dialogue context and task attributes. Further, it employs a fulfillment representation layer for learning how many task attributes have been fulfilled in the dialogue, an importance predictor component for calculating the importance of task attributes. Finally, it predicts the user satisfaction based on task attribute fulfillment and task attribute importance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e. MWOZ, SGD, ReDial, and JDDC) show that SG-USM consistently outperforms competitive existing methods. Our extensive analysis demonstrates that SG-USM can improve the interpretability of user satisfaction modeling, has good scalability as it can effectively deal with unseen tasks and can also effectively work in low-resource settings by leveraging unlabeled data.{Code is available at {https://github.com/amzn/user-satisfaction-modeling}.}","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.116","authors":["Yue Feng","Yunlong Jiao","Animesh Prasad","Nikolaos Aletras","Emine Yilmaz","Gabriella Kazai"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-3_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(oral)"],"id":"P3945","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.116.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76313/poster/cd30b80a6ad7fc744b9776294e250b72.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Schema-Guided User Satisfaction Modeling for Task-Oriented Dialogues","tldr":"User Satisfaction Modeling (USM) is one of the popular choices for task-oriented dialogue systems evaluation, where user satisfaction typically depends on whether the user's task goals were fulfilled by the system.

Contemporary automatic fact-checking systems focus on estimating truthfulness using numerical scores which are not human-interpretable. A human fact-checker generally follows several logical steps to verify a verisimilitude claim and conclude whether it's truthful or a mere masquerade. Popular fact-checking websites follow a common structure for fact categorization such as half true, half false, false, pants on fire, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to have an aspect-based (delineating which part(s) are true and which are false) explainable system that can assist human fact-checkers in asking relevant questions related to a fact, which can then be validated separately to reach a final verdict. In this paper, we propose a 5W framework (who, what, when, where, and why) for question-answer-based fact explainability. To that end, we present a semi-automatically generated dataset called FACTIFY-5WQA, which consists of 391, 041 facts along with relevant 5W QAs \u2013 underscoring our major contribution to this paper. A semantic role labeling system has been utilized to locate 5Ws, which generates QA pairs for claims using a masked language model.

We address issues inherent to evaluating generative approaches to RE by doing human evaluations, in lieu of relying on exact matching. Under this refined evaluation, we find that: (1) Few-shot prompting with GPT-3 achieves near SOTA performance, i.e., roughly equivalent to existing fully supervised models; (2) Flan-T5 is not as capable in the few-shot setting, but supervising and fine-tuning it with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style explanations (generated via GPT-3) yields SOTA results.

Existing estimators independently predict user satisfaction at each turn and ignore satisfaction dynamics across turns within a dialogue. In order to fully simulate users, it is crucial to take satisfaction dynamics into account. To fill this gap, we propose a new estimator ASAP (sAtisfaction eStimation via HAwkes Process) that treats user satisfaction across turns as an event sequence and employs a Hawkes process to effectively model the dynamics in this sequence.

Next, on our CodeTask-CL benchmark, we compare popular CL techniques from NLP and Vision domains. We find that effective methods like Prompt Pooling (PP) suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to the unstable training of the prompt selection mechanism caused by stark distribution shifts in coding tasks. We address this issue with our proposed method, Prompt Pooling with Teacher Forcing (PP-TF), that stabilizes training by enforcing constraints on the prompt selection mechanism and leads to a 21.54\\% improvement over Prompt Pooling.

Experiments show that despite containing a fair amount of noise, training on Unnatural Instructions rivals the effectiveness of training on open-source manually-curated datasets, surpassing the performance of models such as T0++ and Tk-Instruct across various benchmarks. These results demonstrate the potential of model-generated data as a cost-effective alternative to crowdsourcing for dataset expansion and diversification.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.806","authors":["Or Honovich","Thomas Scialom","Omer Levy","Timo Schick"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P4013","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.806.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76958/poster_document/dea37f0dd64406a1356e4bcb5c5e3e9d.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76958/poster/8a8ee4ac8152c61e336eab7922b6df44.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor","tldr":"Instruction tuning enables pretrained language models to perform new tasks from inference-time natural language descriptions.

In both steps, we incorporated a lexical resource to guide the masking process of the language model and, therefore, to help it in paying more attention to words related to mental disorders.

First, CREST generates valid counterfactuals that are more natural than those produced by previous methods, and subsequently can be used for data augmentation at scale, reducing the need for human-generated examples.

We design two methods to achieve this goal: one that leaves models as is but manipulates the data to include features instead of characters, and another that manipulates models to take phonological features into account when building representations for phonemes. We elicit phonemic data from standard graphemic data using language-specific grammars for languages with shallow grapheme-to-phoneme mapping, and we experiment with two reinflection models over eight languages. Our results show that our methods yield comparable results to the grapheme-based baseline overall, with minor improvements in some of the languages.

Furthermore, we show that the median age and age diversity of cited papers were steadily increasing from 1990 to 2014, but since then, the trend has reversed, and current NLP papers have an all-time low temporal citation diversity. Finally, we show that unlike the 1990s, the highly cited papers in the last decade were also papers with the least citation diversity, likely contributing to the intense (and arguably harmful) recency focus.

By leveraging data from multiple clients, the FL paradigm can be especially beneficial for clients that have little training data to develop a data-hungry neural semantic parser on their own. We propose an evaluation setup to study this task, where we re-purpose widely-used single-domain text-to-SQL datasets as clients to form a realistic heterogeneous FL setting and collaboratively train a global model. As standard FL algorithms suffer from the high client heterogeneity in our realistic setup, we further propose a novel LOss Reduction Adjusted Re-weighting (Lorar) mechanism, which adjusts each client's contribution to the global model update based on its training loss reduction during each round. Our intuition is that the larger the loss reduction, the further away the current global model is from the client's local optimum, and the larger weight the client should get. By applying Lorar to three widely adopted FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedOPT and FedProx), we observe that their performance can be improved substantially on average (4\\%-20\\% absolute gain under MacroAvg) and that clients with smaller datasets enjoy larger performance gains. In addition, the global model converges faster for almost all the clients.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.678","authors":["Tianshu Zhang","Changchang Liu","Wei-Han Lee","Yu Su","Huan Sun"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Lexical","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-semantics_-lexical-(poster)"],"id":"P4106","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.678.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76969/poster_document/f6c10706d253ee88e36779908ecbe735.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76969/poster/f01e2aa8c4ec6027f44d518fa8f0d91c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Federated Learning for Semantic Parsing: Task Formulation, Evaluation Setup, New Algorithms","tldr":"This paper studies a new task of federated learning (FL) for semantic parsing, where multiple clients collaboratively train one global model without sharing their semantic parsing data.

To address the data scarcity issue, we propose MetaAdapt, a meta learning based approach for domain adaptive few-shot misinformation detection. MetaAdapt leverages limited target examples to provide feedback and guide the knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain (i.e., learn to adapt). In particular, we train the initial model with multiple source tasks and compute their similarity scores to the meta task. Based on the similarity scores, we rescale the meta gradients to adaptively learn from the source tasks. As such, MetaAdapt can learn how to adapt the misinformation detection model and exploit the source data for improved performance in the target domain. To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we perform extensive experiments to compare MetaAdapt with state-of-the-art baselines and large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, where MetaAdapt achieves better performance in domain adaptive few-shot misinformation detection with substantially reduced parameters on real-world datasets.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.286","authors":["Zhenrui Yue","Huimin Zeng","Yang Zhang","Lanyu Shang","Dong Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics","event_ids":["session-4_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P4130","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.286.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76971/poster_document/559b33c7653b7e463788b94c0f2b2d9d.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76971/poster/039a5e2426712167eb638c4cbe2f7978.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76971/slideshow/da4ae86effca1cee85e5f11b25d22a51.pdf","title":"MetaAdapt: Domain Adaptive Few-Shot Misinformation Detection via Meta Learning","tldr":"With emerging topics (e.g., COVID-19) on social media as a source for the spreading misinformation, overcoming the distributional shifts between the original training domain (i.e., source domain) and such target domains remains a non-trivial task for misinformation detection.

To alleviate this issue, various modifications to a model's sampling distribution, such as top-p or top-k sampling, have been introduced and are now ubiquitously used in language generation systems. We propose a unified framework for understanding these techniques, which we term sampling adapters. Sampling adapters often lead to qualitatively better text, which raises the question: From a formal perspective, how are they changing the token-level distributions of language generation models? And why do these local changes lead to higher-quality text?  We argue that the shift they enforce can be viewed as a trade-off between precision and recall: while the model loses its ability to produce certain strings, its precision rate on desirable text increases.  While this trade-off is not reflected in standard metrics of distribution quality (such as perplexity), we find that several precision-emphasizing measures indeed indicate that sampling adapters can lead to probability distributions more aligned with the true distribution.

The use of such a heuristic raises the question: Can we initialise our models with this behaviour and save precious compute resources and model capacity?

We use  neural machine translation as a test bed for this simple technique and observe that it: (i) improves learning efficiency; (ii) achieves better overall performance; and perhaps most importantly (iii) appears to disentangle strong frequency effects by encouraging the model to specialise in non-frequency-related aspects of language.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.22","authors":["Clara Meister","Wojciech Jan Stokowiec","Tiago Pimentel","Lei Yu","Laura Rimell","Adhiguna Kuncoro"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-generation-(poster)"],"id":"P4155","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.22.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76974/poster_document/26c8c5d37bc08a4cc8855ef39ece70ed.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76974/poster/748fa74e55f1f0fc7fbc82f893dca206.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76974/slideshow/0d0774e72385f67265c5efb5df37766a.pdf","title":"A Natural Bias for Language Generation Models","tldr":"After just a few hundred training updates, a standard probabilistic model for language generation has likely not yet learnt many semantic or syntactic rules of natural language, making it difficult to estimate the probability distribution over next tokens.

Reranking to optimize for \"downstream\" metrics can more closely optimize for quality, but many metrics of interest are computed with pre-trained language models, which are slow to apply to large numbers of hypotheses. We explore an approach for reranking hypotheses by using Transformers to efficiently encode lattices of generated outputs, a method we call EEL. With a single Transformer pass over the entire lattice, we can approximately compute a contextualized representation of each token as if it were only part of a single hypothesis in isolation. We combine this approach with a new class of token-factored rerankers (TFRs) that allow for efficient extraction of high reranker-scoring hypotheses from the lattice. Empirically, our approach incurs minimal degradation error compared to the exponentially slower approach of encoding each hypothesis individually. When applying EEL with TFRs across three text generation tasks, our results show both substantial speedup compared to naive reranking and often better performance on downstream metrics than comparable approaches.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.517","authors":["Prasann Singhal","Jiacheng Xu","Xi Ye","Greg Durrett"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-generation-(poster)"],"id":"P4157","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.517.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76975/poster_document/e187c2fb4ae1fa8f57d7fcfaac2d7aa4.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76975/poster/8f502cbcaf89c3c5cbdd38e93bb23218.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76975/slideshow/80f2db28b94342589ac75ebdc31c8715.pdf","title":"EEL: Efficiently Encoding Lattices for Reranking","tldr":"Standard decoding approaches for conditional text generation tasks typically search for an output hypothesis with high model probability, but this may not yield the best hypothesis according to human judgments of quality.

We study syntactic generalization from the perspective of the capacity to disentangle semantic and structural information, emulating the human capacity to assign a grammaticality judgment to semantically nonsensical sentences. In order to isolate the structure, we propose to represent the probability distribution behind a corpus as the product of the probability of a semantic context and the probability of a structure, the latter being independent of the former. We further elaborate the notion of abstraction as a relaxation of the property of independence. It is based on the measure of structural and contextual information for a given representation. We test abstraction as an optimization objective on the task of inducing syntactic categories from natural language data and show that it significantly outperforms alternative methods. Furthermore, we find that when syntax-unaware optimization objectives succeed in the task, their success is mainly due to an implicit disentanglement process rather than to the model structure. On the other hand, syntactic categories can be deduced in a principled way from the independence between structure and context.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.590","authors":["Rapha\u00ebl Bailly","Laurent Leblond","Kata G\u00e1bor"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P4159","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.590.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76976/poster_document/3f7da65695d345c833a82af2b09aa746.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76976/poster/53dcc924471c70fd8bd3fd0168e27baf.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Syntax and Geometry of Information","tldr":"This paper presents an information-theoretical model of syntactic generalization.

We carefully treat the generalization to semiring-weighted deduction, preprocessing the grammar like Stolcke (1995) to eliminate the possibility of deduction cycles, and further generalize Stolcke's method to compute the weights of sentence prefixes. We also provide implementation details for efficient execution, ensuring that on a preprocessed grammar, the semiring-weighted versions of our methods have the same asymptotic runtime and space requirements as the unweighted methods, including sub-cubic runtime on some grammars.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.204","authors":["Andreas Opedal","Ran Zmigrod","Tim Vieira","Ryan Cotterell","Jason Eisner"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-syntax_-tagging,-chunking,-and-parsing-(poster)"],"id":"P4202","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.204.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76984/poster_document/150724a3bc4abcbb38835e2a8bf7830f.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76984/poster/8993f318236c5ec9ef6a04a83b98d541.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76984/slideshow/52332aa57a82579dc6b590f3ef739ee6.pdf","title":"Efficient Semiring-Weighted Earley Parsing","tldr":"We present Earley's (1970) context-free parsing algorithm as a deduction system, incorporating various known and new speed-ups.

In this work, we propose transferable backdoor attacks against prompt-based models, called NOTABLE, which is independent of downstream tasks and prompting strategies. Specifically, NOTABLE injects backdoors into the encoders of PLMs by utilizing an adaptive verbalizer to bind triggers to specific words (i.e., anchors). It activates the backdoor by pasting input with triggers to reach adversary-desired anchors, achieving independence from downstream tasks and prompting strategies. We conduct experiments on six NLP tasks, three popular models, and three prompting strategies.

However, this approach does not apply to black-box or limited access models such as ChatGPT, as they cannot be fine-tuned. Moreover, in the era of large general-purpose language agents, fine-tuning is neither computationally nor spatially efficient as it results in multiple copies of the network. In this work, we introduce RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback), a multi-agent collaborative framework where the critique generator is trained to maximize end-task performance of GPT-3, a fixed model more than 200 times its size. RL4F produces critiques that help GPT-3 revise its outputs. We study three datasets for action planning, summarization and alphabetization and show relative improvements up to 10\\% in multiple text similarity metrics over other learned, retrieval-augmented or prompting-based critique generators.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.427","authors":["Afra Feyza Akyurek","Ekin Akyurek","Ashwin Kalyan","Peter Clark","Derry Tanti Wijaya","Niket Tandon"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P4238","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.427.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76992/poster_document/6d74d00d26e06f57ebf07c0acdc1c4f0.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76992/poster/9040d65bfa3f31eddde6a064111ddd76.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning for Repairing Model Outputs","tldr":"Despite their unprecedented success, even the largest language models make mistakes.\nSimilar to how humans learn and improve using feedback, previous work proposed providing language models with natural language feedback to guide them in repairing their outputs.

Existing unsupervised approaches become suitable candidates for jointly learning the two tasks due to their avoidance of using graph-text parallel data. However, they adopt multiple complex modules and still require entity information or relation type for training. To this end, we propose INFINITY, a simple yet effective unsupervised method with a unified pretrained language model that does not introduce external annotation tools or additional parallel information. It achieves fully unsupervised graph-text mutual conversion for the first time. Specifically, INFINITY treats both G2T and T2G as a bidirectional sequence generation task by fine-tuning only one pretrained seq2seq model. A novel back-translation-based framework is then designed to generate synthetic parallel data automatically. Besides, we investigate the impact of graph linearization and introduce the structure-aware fine-tuning strategy to alleviate possible performance deterioration via retaining structural information in graph sequences. As a fully unsupervised framework, INFINITY is empirically verified to outperform state-of-the-art baselines for G2T and T2G tasks. Additionally, we also devise a new training setting called cross learning for low-resource unsupervised information extraction.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.281","authors":["Yi Xu","Shuqian Sheng","Jiexing Qi","Luoyi Fu","Zhouhan Lin","Xinbing Wang","Chenghu Zhou"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P424","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.281.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76419/poster_document/6aa9e0f6294e083848e7e2dd1b1167e0.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76419/slideshow/20b3280b974b3c3b43bf17f9c6f37dde.pdf","title":"Unsupervised Graph-Text Mutual Conversion with a Unified Pretrained Language Model","tldr":"Graph-to-text (G2T) generation and text-to-graph (T2G) triple extraction are two essential tasks for knowledge graphs.

To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval and Attribute-Marking enhanced Prompting (RAMP), which leverages large multilingual language models to perform ACT in few-shot and zero-shot settings. RAMP improves generation accuracy over the standard prompting approach by (1) incorporating a semantic similarity retrieval component for selecting similar in-context examples, and (2) marking in-context examples with attribute annotations.

Results on 11 held-out tasks show that FiD-ICL matches or outperforms the other two fusion methods. Additionally, we show that FiD-ICL (1) is 10x faster at inference time compared to concat-based and ensemble-based ICL, as we can easily pre-compute the representations of in-context examples and reuse them; (2) enables scaling up to meta-training 3B-sized models, which would fail for concat-based ICL.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.454","authors":["Qinyuan Ye","Iz Beltagy","Matthew Peters","Xiang Ren","Hannaneh Hajishirzi"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P4254","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.454.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76994/poster_document/6b7f5cebffb13e7689bced95c8b12473.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76994/poster/a07a2f92ed61bcd1373b32fb00488a0e.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76994/slideshow/a47b2df8a038bc455660a1526c692b9a.pdf","title":"FiD-ICL: A Fusion-in-Decoder Approach for Efficient In-Context Learning","tldr":"Large pre-trained models are capable of few-shot in-context learning (ICL), i.e., performing a new task by prepending a few demonstrations before the test input.

While it is thought to be essential for robust reasoning in AI systems, conventional approaches require significant training and/or hard-coding of domain knowledge to be applied to benchmark tasks. Inspired by cognitive science research that has found connections between human language and analogy-making, we explore the use of intuitive language-based abstractions to support analogy in AI systems. Specifically, we apply large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to visual Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a common relational reasoning test. By simply encoding the perceptual features of the problem into language form, we find that PLMs exhibit a striking capacity for zero-shot relational reasoning, exceeding human performance and nearing supervised vision-based methods. We explore different encodings that vary the level of abstraction over task features, finding that higher-level abstractions further strengthen PLMs' analogical reasoning. Our detailed analysis reveals insights on the role of model complexity, in-context learning, and prior knowledge in solving RPM tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.109","authors":["Xiaoyang Hu","Shane Storks","Richard L.

In this paper, we investigate how to most efficiently use a fixed budget to build a compact model. Through extensive experiments on six diverse tasks, we show that distilling from T5-XXL (11B) to T5-Small (60M) is almost always a cost-efficient strategy compared to annotating more data to directly train a compact model (T5-Small). We further investigate how the optimal budget allocated towards computation varies across scenarios. We will make our code, datasets, annotation cost estimates, and baseline models available as a benchmark to support further work on cost-efficient training of compact models.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.622","authors":["Junmo Kang","Wei Xu","Alan Ritter"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P4263","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.622.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76997/poster_document/c08ac98de4dc83064526a026d282790d.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76997/poster/f3df15574322c971b3b6adcc3015b18f.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76997/slideshow/af9e277d88854f39dafe0527eb77228d.pdf","title":"Distill or Annotate?

Dungeons and Dragons (D\\&D), a role-playing game, provides an ideal setting to investigate such interactions. Here, the Dungeon Master (DM), i.e., the teacher, guides the actions of several players---students, each with their own personas and abilities---to achieve shared goals grounded in a fantasy world. Our approach is to decompose and model these interactions into (1) the DM's intent to guide players toward a given goal; (2) the DM's guidance utterance to the players expressing this intent; and (3) a theory-of-mind (ToM) model that anticipates the players' reaction to the guidance one turn into the future. We develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for training a DM that generates guidance for players by rewarding utterances where the intent matches the ToM-anticipated player actions. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained to explicitly model intents and incorporate ToM of the players using RL generates better-quality guidance that is 3x more likely to fulfill the DM's intent than a vanilla natural language generation (NLG) approach.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.624","authors":["Pei Zhou","Andrew Zhu","Jennifer Hu","Jay Pujara","Xiang Ren","Chris Callison-Burch","Yejin Choi","Prithviraj Ammanabrolu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["poster-session-5_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(poster)"],"id":"P4289","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.624.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77001/poster/fa10be221ad41535e3a8f8b7c00df8c6.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"I Cast Detect Thoughts: Learning to Converse and Guide with Intents and Theory-of-Mind in Dungeons and Dragons","tldr":"We propose a novel task, G4C, to study teacher-student natural language interactions in a goal-driven and grounded environment.

Distant supervision (DS) is able to generate massive auto-labeled data, which can improve DocRE performance. Recent works leverage pseudo labels generated by the pre-denoising model to reduce noise in DS data. However, unreliable pseudo labels bring new noise, e.g., adding false pseudo labels and losing correct DS labels. Therefore, how to select effective pseudo labels to denoise DS data is still a challenge in document-level distant relation extraction. To tackle this issue, we introduce uncertainty estimation technology to determine whether pseudo labels can be trusted. In this work, we propose a Document-level distant Relation Extraction framework with Uncertainty Guided label denoising, UGDRE. Specifically, we propose a novel instance-level uncertainty estimation method, which measures the reliability of the pseudo labels with overlapping relations. By further considering the long-tail problem, we design dynamic uncertainty thresholds for different types of relations to filter high-uncertainty pseudo labels. We conduct experiments on two public datasets. Our framework outperforms strong baselines by 1.91 F1 and 2.28 Ign F1 on the RE-DocRED dataset.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.889","authors":["Qi Sun","Kun Huang","Xiaocui Yang","Pengfei Hong","Kun Zhang","Soujanya Poria"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["session-7_-information-extraction-(oral)"],"id":"P430","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.889.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76188/poster_document/74e5ae5b3b46730097d37e260a660db6.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76188/poster/d1f4c30dd3fc8ac2fd55cf8ffe493106.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76188/slideshow/b24cab59ee580a331175984c03fed007.pdf","title":"Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction","tldr":"Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to infer complex semantic relations among entities in a document.

These differences in performance so far do not appear to be related to any particular feature of the datasets or characteristics of the languages. These findings have important implications for future research in ASR for under-resourced languages. ASR systems for languages with abundant existing media and available speakers may derive the most benefit simply by collecting large amounts of additional acoustic and textual training data.

Most recent works on meeting transcripts primarily focus on summarization and extraction of action items. However, meeting discussions also have a useful question-answering (QA) component, crucial to understanding the discourse or meeting content, and can be used to build interactive interfaces on top of long transcripts. Hence, in this work, we leverage this inherent QA component of meeting discussions and introduce MeetingQA, an extractive QA dataset comprising of questions asked by meeting participants and corresponding responses. As a result, questions can be open-ended and actively seek discussions, while the answers can be multi-span and distributed across multiple speakers. Our comprehensive empirical study of several robust baselines including long-context language models and recent instruction-tuned models reveals that models perform poorly on this task (F1 = 57.3) and severely lag behind human performance (F1 = 84.6), thus presenting a challenging new task for the community to improve upon.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.837","authors":["Archiki Prasad","Trung Bui","Seunghyun Yoon","Hanieh Deilamsalehy","Franck Dernoncourt","Mohit Bansal"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Question Answering","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-question-answering-(poster)"],"id":"P4357","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.837.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77009/poster_document/76fc376dc467b860bea217820f62cc29.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77009/poster/8f81d434d5dd8c7e2af13f9bf59fee17.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77009/slideshow/4d0c4448dc693be219a268b47c80afe0.pdf","title":"MeetingQA: Extractive Question-Answering on Meeting Transcripts","tldr":"With the ubiquitous use of online meeting platforms and robust automatic speech recognition systems, meeting transcripts have emerged as a promising domain for natural language tasks.

It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics. The training data is limited as most songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned melody-lyric data.  Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics. The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from inference (melody-guided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of parallel data.\n\nWe leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during inference.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of task-specific KD techniques for various NLG tasks under realistic assumptions. We discuss the special characteristics of NLG distillation and particularly the exposure bias problem. Following, we derive a family of Pseudo-Target (PT) augmentation methods, substantially extending prior work on sequence-level KD. We propose the Joint-Teaching method, which applies word-level KD to multiple PTs generated by both the teacher and the student.\nFinally, we validate our findings in an extreme setup with no labeled examples using GPT-4 as the teacher.

An alternative to subword tokenizers is byte-based tokenization, i.e., tokenization into byte sequences using the UTF-8 encoding scheme. Byte tokens often represent inputs at a sub-character granularity, i.e., one character can be represented by a span of byte tokens.

However, standard benchmarking datasets like ACE and ERE cover less than 40 event types and 25 entity-centric argument roles. Limited diversity and coverage hinder these datasets from adequately evaluating the generalizability of EAE models. In this paper, we first contribute by creating a large and diverse EAE ontology. This ontology is created by transforming FrameNet, a comprehensive semantic role labeling (SRL) dataset for EAE, by exploiting the similarity between these two tasks. Then, exhaustive human expert annotations are collected to build the ontology, concluding with 115 events and 220 argument roles, with a significant portion of roles not being entities. We utilize this ontology to further introduce GENEVA, a diverse generalizability benchmarking dataset comprising four test suites aimed at evaluating models' ability to handle limited data and unseen event type generalization. We benchmark six EAE models from various families.

Due to the complexity of visual scenes in multi-party conversations, most previous MERMC studies mainly focus on text and audio modalities while ignoring visual information. Recently, several works proposed to extract face sequences as visual features and have shown the importance of visual information in MERMC. However, given an utterance, the face sequence extracted by previous methods may contain multiple people's faces, which will inevitably introduce noise to the emotion prediction of the real speaker. To tackle this issue, we propose a two-stage framework named Facial expressionaware Multimodal Multi-Task learning (FacialMMT). Specifically, a pipeline method is first designed to extract the face sequence of the real speaker of each utterance, which consists of multimodal face recognition, unsupervised face clustering, and face matching. With the extracted face sequences, we propose a multimodal facial expression-aware emotion recognition model, which leverages the frame-level facial emotion distributions to help improve utterance-level emotion recognition based on multi-task learning.

In this paper, we show that carefully curating a subset of training data greatly stabilizes ICL performance without any other changes to the ICL algorithm (e.g., prompt retrieval or calibration). We introduce two methods to choose training subsets---both score training examples individually, then select the highest-scoring ones. CondAcc scores a training example by its average dev-set ICL accuracy when combined with random training examples, while Datamodels learns linear regressors that estimate how the presence of each training example influences LLM outputs. \nAcross five tasks and two LLMs, sampling from stable subsets selected by CondAcc and Datamodels improves average accuracy over sampling from the entire training set by 7.7\\% and 6.3\\%, respectively.\nSurprisingly, the stable subset examples are not especially diverse in content or low in perplexity, in contrast with other work suggesting that diversity and perplexity are important when prompting LLMs.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.452","authors":["Ting-Yun Chang","Robin Jia"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P4513","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.452.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77035/poster_document/b8c6bb428589b86d5792f388358b02ae.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77035/poster/9998f10978345b9afb1f52e9b6785271.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77035/slideshow/308cd543002d144359ee356343a7a6d3.pdf","title":"Data Curation Alone Can Stabilize In-context Learning","tldr":"In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new tasks by prompting them with a sequence of training examples.

This is especially true in the case of MDS for biomedical literature reviews, where models must synthesize contradicting evidence reported across different documents. Prior work has shown that rather than performing the task, models may exploit shortcuts that are difficult to detect using standard n-gram similarity metrics such as ROUGE. Better automated evaluation metrics are needed, but few resources exist to assess metrics when they are proposed. Therefore, we introduce a dataset of human-assessed summary quality facets and pairwise preferences to encourage and support the development of better automated evaluation methods for literature review MDS. We take advantage of community submissions to the Multi-document Summarization for Literature Review (MSLR) shared task to compile a diverse and representative sample of generated summaries. We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed summary quality. We find that not only do automated metrics fail to capture aspects of quality as assessed by humans, in many cases the system rankings produced by these metrics are anti-correlated with rankings according to human annotators.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.549","authors":["Lucy Lu Wang","Yulia Otmakhova","Jay DeYoung","Thinh Hung Truong","Bailey E.

However, many of these approaches suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on concatenating lengthy instructions with every input example, resulting in costly reprocessing of the instruction. To avoid this, we introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task instructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an underlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to include instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces an encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during decoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\\% when controlling for compute (measured in FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively disregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of compute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25\\% by incorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5\\% more compute.

Experimental results on four low-resource translation tasks show that kNN-TL outperforms strong baselines. Extensive analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Incorporating such information into generation-based models is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of the natural language form prevalently used in generation-based models and the structured form of AMRs. In this work, we study strategies to incorporate AMR into generation-based EAE models. We propose AMPERE, which generates AMR-aware prefixes for every layer of the generation model. Thus, the prefix introduces AMR information to the generation-based EAE model and then improves the generation. We also introduce an adjusted copy mechanism to AMPERE to help overcome potential noises brought by the AMR graph. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on ACE2005 and ERE datasets show that AMPERE can get 4\\% - 10\\% absolute F1 score improvements with reduced training data and it is in general powerful across different training sizes.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.615","authors":["I-Hung Hsu","Zhiyu Xie","Kuan-Hao Huang","Prem Natarajan","Nanyun Peng"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"id":"P4558","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.615.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77043/poster_document/f65ad3e3b23994f89074b7c8f74febc6.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77043/poster/7cde65389fc329e4b9c58d17ccad98a7.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"AMPERE: AMR-Aware Prefix for Generation-Based Event Argument Extraction Model","tldr":"Event argument extraction (EAE) identifies event arguments and their specific roles for a given event.

Unlike standard finetuning where the model only predicts the answer given the input, we finetune the model to additionally generate a free-text explanation supporting its answer. To evaluate our method, we finetune the model on artificially constructed training sets containing different types of spurious cues, and test it on a test set without these cues. Compared to standard finetuning, our method makes GPT-3 (davinci) remarkably more robust against spurious cues in terms of accuracy drop across four classification tasks: ComVE (+1.2), CREAK (+9.1), e-SNLI (+15.4), and SBIC (+6.5). The efficacy generalizes across multiple model families and scales, with greater gains for larger models. Finally, our method also works well with explanations generated by the model, implying its applicability to more datasets without human-written explanations.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.242","authors":["Josh Magnus Ludan","Yixuan Meng","Tai Nguyen","Saurabh Shah","Qing Lyu","Marianna Apidianaki","Chris Callison-Burch"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P4559","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.242.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77044/poster_document/91fc22389fe9b811cfc06ef4749f5453.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77044/poster/ee027f5c6e6324ac09e72f0f7878e1d0.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77044/slideshow/7f66a3ff1a45a81e3221fee7dbdede08.pdf","title":"Explanation-based Finetuning Makes Models More Robust to Spurious Cues","tldr":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are so powerful that they sometimes learn correlations between labels and features that are irrelevant to the task, leading to poor generalization on out-of-distribution data.

Here, we demonstrate that the original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and propose an adapted metric, in which we mask not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target. We show that our adapted metric (PLL-word-l2r) outperforms both the original PLL metric and a PLL metric in which all within-word tokens are masked. In particular, it better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models. Finally, we show that the choice of metric affects even tightly controlled, minimal pair evaluation benchmarks (such as BLiMP), underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM properties.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.80","authors":["Carina Kauf","Anna Ivanova"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Resources and Evaluation","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(poster)"],"id":"P4593","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.80.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77053/poster_document/86fadd279c4c709fcf576c5dd2024918.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77053/poster/72267ca41e5a932a7d8b65f1e60b8c04.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77053/slideshow/08dde0e78534b6e213bb1765d9e5079e.pdf","title":"A Better Way to Do Masked Language Model Scoring","tldr":"Estimating the log-likelihood of a given sentence under an autoregressive language model is straightforward: one can simply apply the chain rule and sum the log-likelihood values for each successive token.

However, sampling from EBMs is non-trivial, as it often requires a large number of iterations to converge to plausible text, which slows down the decoding process and makes it less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose BOLT, which relies on tunable biases to directly adjust the language model's output logits. Unlike prior work, BOLT maintains the generator's autoregressive nature to assert a strong control on token-wise conditional dependencies and overall fluency, and thus converges faster. When compared with state-of-the-arts on controlled generation tasks using both soft constraints (e.g., sentiment control) and hard constraints (e.g., keyword-guided topic control), BOLT demonstrates significantly improved efficiency and fluency. On sentiment control, BOLT is 7x faster than competitive baselines, and more fluent in 74.4\\% of the evaluation samples according to human judges.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.18","authors":["Xin Liu","Muhammad Khalifa","Lu Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["poster-session-3_-generation-(poster)"],"id":"P4614","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.18.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77056/poster_document/b7868e7bcd5fa32c27bc852cb796d079.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77056/poster/0d85385bc7a4e99a40f0f981fec91aca.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"BOLT: Fast Energy-based Controlled Text Generation with Tunable Biases","tldr":"Energy-based models (EBMs) have gained popularity for controlled text generation due to their high applicability to a wide range of constraints.

ScTD aims to encourage the model to learn how to preserve the semantic information in the representation space. Extensive experiments on 12 tasks show that, with the help of our ScTD, token dropping can achieve consistent and significant performance gains across all task types and model sizes.

In this paper, we propose to leverage question decomposing for heterogeneous knowledge integration, by breaking down a complex question into simpler ones, and selecting the appropriate knowledge source for each sub-question. To facilitate reasoning, we propose a novel two-stage XQA framework, Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (RoHT).

The experiments on complex QA datasets KQA Pro and Musique show that our framework outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging question decomposing for knowledge integration and our RoHT framework.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.814","authors":["Jiajie Zhang","Shulin Cao","Tingjian Zhang","Xin Lv","Juanzi Li","Lei Hou","Jiaxin Shi","Qi Tian"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Question Answering","event_ids":["session-4_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P4660","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.814.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77058/poster_document/64b543fccaad8400d2cf9a3921e0f6a1.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77058/poster/06f0c003b4547da754b285c5b3905b4c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77058/slideshow/c47660b065e65058aba5594608180814.pdf","title":"Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering","tldr":"Explainable question answering (XQA) aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected.

In this paper, we alleviate these issues through a graph-based method.  We first chunk the sequence with a fixed length to model the sentence-level information. We then leverage graphs to model intra- and cross-sentence correlations with a new attention mechanism. Additionally, due to limited standard benchmarks for long document classification (LDC), we propose a new challenging benchmark, totaling six datasets with up to 53k samples and 4034 average tokens' length.

These works attempt to leverage knowledge graphs, the de facto standard of symbolic knowledge representation, along with pre-trained LMs. While existing approaches leverage external knowledge, it remains an open question how to jointly incorporate knowledge graphs represented in varying contexts --- from local (e.g., sentence), document-level, to global knowledge, to enable knowledge-rich and interpretable exchange across contexts. In addition, incorporating varying contexts can especially benefit long document understanding tasks that leverage pre-trained LMs, typically bounded by the input sequence length. In light of these challenges, we propose KALM, a language model that jointly leverages knowledge in local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding. KALM firstly encodes long documents and knowledge graphs into the three knowledge-aware context representations. KALM then processes each context with context-specific layers. These context-specific layers are followed by a ContextFusion layer that facilitates knowledge exchange to derive an overarching document representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three long document understanding tasks across 6 datasets/settings. Further analyses reveal that the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to model performance, while the importance and information exchange patterns of different contexts vary on different tasks and datasets.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.118","authors":["Shangbin Feng","Zhaoxuan Tan","Wenqian Zhang","Zhenyu Lei","Yulia Tsvetkov"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-5_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P4694","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.118.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77063/poster_document/4558d74b163562096d187526edeea8dc.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77063/poster/e1d3a27a83823bb8fe5bab8e1971c9ba.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"KALM: Knowledge-Aware Integration of Local, Document, and Global Contexts for Long Document Understanding","tldr":"With the advent of pre-trained language models (LMs), increasing research efforts have been focusing on infusing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge to prepare LMs for downstream tasks.

In this scenario, previous studies concentrate on overcoming catastrophic forgetting while lacking encouragement to learn new knowledge from incremental language pairs, especially when the incremental language is not related to the set of original languages. To better acquire new knowledge, we propose a knowledge transfer method that can efficiently adapt original MNMT models to diverse incremental language pairs. The method flexibly introduces the knowledge from an external model into original models, which encourages the models to learn new language pairs, completing the procedure of knowledge transfer. Moreover, all original parameters are frozen to ensure that translation qualities on original language pairs are not degraded. Experimental results show that our method can learn new knowledge from diverse language pairs incrementally meanwhile maintaining performance on original language pairs, outperforming various strong baselines in incremental learning for MNMT.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.852","authors":["Kaiyu Huang","Peng Li","Jin Ma","Ting Yao","Yang Liu"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-2_-machine-translation-(oral)"],"id":"P4709","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.852.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76335/poster_document/528ab6e4b887ae9c39ae4d80e2b2b220.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76335/poster/c1aa29a97e67063b7b2e209dc2a2568b.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76335/slideshow/d1034608ebd9176b17b2ba367bc37420.pdf","title":"Knowledge Transfer in Incremental Learning for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation","tldr":"In the real-world scenario, a longstanding goal of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) is that a single model can incrementally adapt to new language pairs without accessing previous training data.

Contemporary methods explore more efficient transformers or divide long documents into passages to handle the long input.  However, intensive query-irrelevant content may lead to harmful distraction and high query latency. Some recent works further propose cascade document ranking models that extract relevant passages with an efficient selector before ranking, however, their selection and ranking modules are almost independently optimized and deployed, leading to selecting error reinforcement and sub-optimal performance. In fact, the document ranker can provide fine-grained supervision to make the selector more generalizable and compatible, and the selector built upon a different structure can offer a distinct perspective to assist in document ranking. Inspired by this, we propose a fine-grained attention alignment approach to jointly optimize a cascade document ranking model. Specifically, we utilize the attention activations over the passages from the ranker as fine-grained attention feedback to optimize the selector. Meanwhile, we fuse the relevance scores from the passage selector into the ranker to assist in calculating the cooperative matching representation.

To mitigate this opacity, this work presents a linear decomposition of final hidden states from autoregressive language models based on each initial input token, which is exact for virtually all contemporary Transformer architectures. This decomposition allows the definition of probability distributions that ablate the contribution of specific input tokens, which can be used to analyze their influence on model probabilities over a sequence of upcoming words with only one forward pass from the model. Using the change in next-word probability as a measure of importance, this work first examines which context words make the biggest contribution to language model predictions. Regression experiments suggest that Transformer-based language models rely primarily on collocational associations, followed by linguistic factors such as syntactic dependencies and coreference relationships in making next-word predictions. Additionally, analyses using these measures to predict syntactic dependencies and coreferent mention spans show that collocational association and repetitions of the same token largely explain the language models' predictions on these tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.562","authors":["Byung-Doh Oh","William Schuler"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P4763","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.562.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77069/poster_document/0add5d2df0bbdbf8074cf7c4c6a07d63.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77069/poster/50e3b4c302744dda70142dc24a716264.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77069/slideshow/c25e43a549800e19ffc821752c468a9b.pdf","title":"Token-wise Decomposition of Autoregressive Language Model Hidden States for Analyzing Model Predictions","tldr":"While there is much recent interest in studying why Transformer-based large language models make predictions the way they do, the complex computations performed within each layer have made their behavior somewhat opaque.

Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the \"pushing'' operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning due to better alignment.

However, the existing QA models always rely on shortcuts, e.g., providing the true answer by only one fact, rather than multi-hop reasoning, which is referred as disconnected reasoning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel counterfactual multihop QA, a causal-effect approach that enables to reduce the disconnected reasoning. It builds upon explicitly modeling of causality: 1) the direct causal effects of disconnected reasoning and 2) the causal effect of true multi-hop reasoning from the total causal effect. With the causal graph,  a counterfactual inference is proposed  to disentangle the disconnected reasoning from the total causal effect, which provides us a new perspective and technology to learn a QA model that exploits the true multi-hop reasoning instead of shortcuts.

We present a careful analysis of experts' evaluation, which focuses on new aspects such as the comprehensiveness of the answer. Next, we examine automatic text generation metrics, finding that no existing metrics are predictive of human preference judgments.

In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Mixup via Optimal Transport (CMOT) to overcome the modality gap. We find the alignment between speech and text sequences via optimal transport and then mix up the sequences from different modalities at a token level using the alignment. Experiments on the MuST-C ST benchmark demonstrate that CMOT achieves an average BLEU of 30.0 in 8 translation directions, outperforming previous methods. Further analysis shows CMOT can adaptively find the alignment between modalities, which helps alleviate the modality gap between speech and text.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.436","authors":["Yan Zhou","Qingkai Fang","Yang Feng"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-7_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P4782","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.436.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77070/poster_document/9c741901dc820a87ca2f6390569db6cd.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77070/poster/61f45c4bf5b828d576bcbf043588eecb.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77070/slideshow/ed59e614c53f70da6211288a626d5880.pptx","title":"CMOT: Cross-modal Mixup via Optimal Transport for Speech Translation","tldr":"End-to-end speech translation (ST) is the task of translating speech signals in the source language into text in the target language.

Prior work has studied targeted updates to LMs, injecting individual facts and evaluating whether the model learns these facts while not changing predictions on other contexts. We take a step forward and study LMs' abilities to make inferences based on injected facts (or propagate those facts): for example, after learning that something is a TV show, does an LM predict that you can watch it? We study this with two cloze-style tasks: an existing dataset of real-world sentences about novel entities (ECBD) as well as a new controlled benchmark with manually designed templates requiring varying levels of inference about injected knowledge. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods for updating knowledge (gradient-based fine-tuning and modifications of this approach) show little propagation of injected knowledge. These methods improve performance on cloze instances only when there is lexical overlap between injected facts and target inferences. Yet, prepending entity definitions in an LM's context improves performance across all settings, suggesting that there is substantial headroom for parameter-updating approaches for knowledge injection.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.300","authors":["Yasumasa Onoe","Michael J.Q.

We propose a hierarchical duality learning for dialogue (HDLD) to simulate this human cognitive ability, for generating high quality responses that connect both previous and follow-up dialogues. HDLD utilizes hierarchical dualities at token hierarchy and utterance hierarchy. HDLD maximizes the mutual information between past and future utterances. Thus, even if future text is invisible during inference, HDLD is capable of estimating future information implicitly based on dialogue history and generates both coherent and informative responses. In contrast to previous approaches that solely utilize future text as auxiliary information to encode during training, HDLD leverages duality to enable interaction between dialogue history and the future. This enhances the utilization of dialogue data, leading to the improvement in both automatic and human evaluation.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.407","authors":["Ang Lv","Jinpeng Li","Shufang Xie","Rui Yan"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-3_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(oral)"],"id":"P481","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.407.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76189/poster_document/a5c99063fd6699a9196d6bfdae6437b5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76189/poster/efdc3a72fef7e9deb0b5e0477f46894e.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Envisioning Future from the Past: Hierarchical Duality Learning for Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation","tldr":"In this paper, we define a widely neglected property in dialogue text, duality, which is a hierarchical property that is reflected in human behaviours in daily conversations: Based on the logic in a conversation (or a sentence), people can infer follow-up utterances (or tokens) based on the previous...","track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","underline_id":76189,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/sessions/15224/lecture/76189-envisioning-future-from-the-past-hierarchical-duality-learning-for-multi-turn-dialogue-generation","video_url":null},{"abstract":"We present a framework that formulates visual question answering as modular code generation.

We find that NLP literature has not given enough attention to the phenomenon of negative transfer. To understand patterns of both positive and negative transfer between L1 and L2, we model sequential second language acquisition in LMs. Further, we build a Mutlilingual Age Ordered CHILDES (MAO-CHILDES)\u2014a dataset consisting of 5 typologically diverse languages, i.e., German, French, Polish, Indonesian, and Japanese\u2014to understand the degree to which native Child-Directed Speech (CDS) [L1] can help or conflict with English language acquisition [L2].

NLU models should thus account for such ambiguity, but they approximate the human opinion distributions quite poorly and tend to produce over-confident predictions. To address this problem, we must consider how to exactly capture the degree of relationship between each sample and its candidate classes. In this work, we propose a novel method with deep model compression and show how such relationship can be accounted for. We see that more reasonably represented relationships can be discovered in the lower layers and that validation accuracies are converging at these layers, which naturally leads to layer pruning. We also see that distilling the relationship knowledge from a lower layer helps models produce better distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method makes substantial improvement on quantifying ambiguity without gold distribution labels. As positive side-effects, our method is found to reduce the model size significantly and improve latency, both attractive aspects of NLU products.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.381","authors":["Hancheol Park","Jong Park"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-1_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P4867","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.381.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77081/poster_document/673c6be7418203944b1872e554a496df.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77081/poster/b10c5a9e16c18db920c8fa3bf6043934.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77081/slideshow/0a02d6dbe2bb53505dd0ac64983481df.pdf","title":"Deep Model Compression Also Helps Models Capture Ambiguity","tldr":"Natural language understanding (NLU) tasks face a non-trivial amount of ambiguous samples where veracity of their labels is debatable among annotators.

In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method \\textbf{DEER}, which can make a single pre-trained model support \\textbf{D}ynamic and \\textbf{E}fficient inf\\textbf{ER}ence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 $\\to$ 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

We propose to reframe the standard greedy autoregressive decoding of MT with a parallel formulation leveraging Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel fixed-point iteration methods for fast inference.\nThis formulation allows to speed up existing models without training or modifications while retaining translation quality. We present three parallel decoding algorithms and test them on different languages and models showing how the parallelization introduces a speedup up to 38\\% w.r.t. the standard autoregressive decoding and nearly 2x when scaling the method on parallel resources. Finally, we introduce a decoding dependency graph visualizer (DDGviz) that let us see how the model has learned the conditional dependence between tokens and inspect the decoding procedure.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.689","authors":["Andrea Santilli","Silvio Severino","Emilian Postolache","Valentino Maiorca","Michele Mancusi","Riccardo Marin","Emanuele Rodola"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-machine-translation-(poster)"],"id":"P505","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.689.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76432/poster_document/a1a272e8d677a77ba24831a3e15dde05.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Accelerating Transformer Inference for Translation via Parallel Decoding","tldr":"Autoregressive decoding limits the efficiency of transformers for Machine Translation (MT).

For example, toxicity detection in user-generated content is a subjective task, and notions of toxicity can be annotated according to a variety of definitions that can be in conflict with one another. Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that state-of-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty estimation method that combines epistemic and aleatoric UE methods. We show that by using our hybrid method, we can outperform state-of-the-art UE methods for toxicity detection and other ambiguous text classification tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.652","authors":["Artem Vazhentsev","Gleb Kuzmin","Akim Tsvigun","Alexander Panchenko","Maxim Panov","Mikhail Burtsev","Artem Shelmanov"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5065","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.652.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77104/poster_document/81db2e209f5fffcadc8100910e2a6ff5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77104/poster/31d9627b50e69b14b03b3c7a31e4033b.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77104/slideshow/23c2a795333d74c6232fbd67c95af0c9.pdf","title":"Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Selective Text Classification in Ambiguous Tasks","tldr":"Many text classification tasks are inherently ambiguous, which results in automatic systems having a high risk of making mistakes, in spite of using advanced machine learning models.

Our experiments demonstrate that an ideal utterance selection can significantly reduce the error and bias in the translated data, resulting in higher parser accuracies than the parsers merely trained on the machine-translated data.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.529","authors":["Zhuang Li","Lizhen Qu","Philip Cohen","Raj V Tumuluri","Gholamreza Haffari"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference, and Other Areas","event_ids":["session-1_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5112","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.529.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77109/poster_document/51d470e22649e788ac7adbac0ab43669.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77109/poster/f943da06a07ea3e3fa718a31af1a8767.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77109/slideshow/73d03bd67b34c41a98d19723ef3535be.pdf","title":"The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Human and Machine Translations for Multilingual Semantic Parsing with Active Learning","tldr":"Multilingual semantic parsing aims to leverage the knowledge from the high-resource languages to improve low-resource semantic parsing, yet commonly suffers from the data imbalance problem.

In this work, we introduce a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level. Concretely, we design an intra-word module that uses a shallow Transformer architecture to learn word representations from their characters, and a deep inter-word Transformer module that contextualizes each word representation by attending to the entire word sequence. Our model thus directly operates on character sequences with explicit awareness of word boundaries, but without biased sub-word or word-level vocabulary. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines. We also demonstrate that our hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.200","authors":["Li Sun","Florian Luisier","Kayhan Batmanghelich","Dinei Florencio","Cha Zhang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-7_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P518","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.200.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76435/poster_document/802aded6f6c4876b4ee03a217e81254b.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76435/slideshow/da69328e570f847b9b7d57d98b569609.pdf","title":"From Characters to Words: Hierarchical Pre-trained Language Model for Open-vocabulary Language Understanding","tldr":"Current state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding require a preprocessing step to convert raw text into discrete tokens.

This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models.

In this paper, we propose AlignScore, a new holistic metric that applies to a variety of factual inconsistency scenarios as above. AlignScore is based on a general function of information alignment between two arbitrary text pieces. Crucially, we develop a unified training framework of the alignment function by integrating a large diversity of data sources, resulting in 4.7M training examples from 7 well-established tasks (NLI, QA, paraphrasing, fact verification, information retrieval, semantic similarity, and summarization). We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks including 22 evaluation datasets, where 19 of the datasets were never seen in the alignment training. AlignScore achieves substantial improvement over a wide range of previous metrics. Moreover, AlignScore (355M parameters) matches or even outperforms metrics based on ChatGPT and GPT-4 that are orders of magnitude larger.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.634","authors":["Yuheng Zha","Yichi Yang","Ruichen Li","Zhiting Hu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5206","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.634.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77114/poster_document/0e08d2eab0881e4d94537edc423a11f8.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77114/poster/a0bcbe016468f3441ea21d8af91d3fad.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"AlignScore: Evaluating Factual Consistency with A Unified Alignment Function","tldr":"Many text generation applications require the generated text to be factually consistent with input information.

To address this issue, we propose Focus Learning (FocusL), a novel learning approach that adjusts the contribution of each token to the optimization direction by directly scaling the corresponding objective loss. Specifically, we first introduce a positioning method by utilizing similarity distributions between knowledge and each response token to locate knowledge-aware tokens. Then, we further design a similarity-to-weight transformation to provide dynamic token-level weights for the cross-entropy loss. Finally, we use the weighted loss to encourage the model to pay special attention to the knowledge utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art results and generates more reliable responses while maintaining training stability.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.250","authors":["Yifan Deng","Xingsheng Zhang","Heyan Huang","Yue Hu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(poster)"],"id":"P5234","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.250.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77115/poster_document/9a5892ec4dc58ac94cc601ac68d881c7.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77115/poster/f7b7c1a3317e50fe406cb443e4706f7e.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Towards Faithful Dialogues via Focus Learning","tldr":"Maintaining faithfulness between responses and knowledge is an important research topic for building reliable knowledge-grounded dialogue systems.

However, current work typically overestimates model performance as fine-tuned models are frequently evaluated at model checkpoints that generalize best to validation instances in the target languages. This effectively violates the main assumptions of \u2018true' ZS-XLT and FS-XLT. Such XLT setups require robust methods that do not depend on labeled target language data for validation and model selection. In this work, aiming to improve the robustness of \u2018true' ZS-XLT and FS-XLT, we propose a simple and effective method that averages different checkpoints (i.e., model snapshots) during task fine-tuning. We conduct exhaustive ZS-XLT and FS-XLT experiments across higher-level semantic tasks (NLI, extractive QA) and lower-level token classification tasks (NER, POS). The results indicate that averaging model checkpoints yields systematic and consistent performance gains across diverse target languages in all tasks. Importantly, it simultaneously substantially desensitizes XLT to varying hyperparameter choices in the absence of target language validation. We also show that checkpoint averaging benefits performance when further combined with run averaging (i.e., averaging the parameters of models fine-tuned over independent runs).","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.314","authors":["Fabian David Schmidt","Ivan Vuli\u0107","Goran Glava\u0161"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P5238","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.314.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77116/poster_document/465e32fbccb852d30634d3c026f9d39e.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77116/poster/5834a850f3b7a9b694a842a79dfbff1f.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Free Lunch: Robust Cross-Lingual Transfer via Model Checkpoint Averaging","tldr":"Massively multilingual language models have displayed strong performance in zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer setups, where models fine-tuned on task data in a source language are transferred without any or with only a few annotated instances to the target language(s). ...","track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","underline_id":77116,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/posters/15237/poster/77116-free-lunch-robust-cross-lingual-transfer-via-model-checkpoint-averaging","video_url":null},{"abstract":"This paper focuses on the task of cross domain few-shot named entity recognition (NER), which aims to adapt the knowledge learned from source domain to recognize named entities in target domain with only a few labeled examples.

However, for the persona-based dialogue generation task, consistency and coherence are also key factors, which are great challenges for language models. Existing works mainly focus on valuable data filtering, model structure modifying, or objective function designing, while their improvements are limited and hard to generalize to all types of pre-trained language models. However, we find that language models can produce consistent and coherent responses if we consider enough generations. Thus, the problems lay in large-scale response generation and target response selection. In this work, a simple but effective two-stage SimOAP strategy is proposed, i.e., over-sampling and post-evaluation. The over-sampling stage takes large-scale responses from existing trained models efficiently via off-the-shelf distilling and compressing methods, and the post-evaluation stage selects a good response based on multiple well-designed evaluation metrics from large-scale candidates. Experimental results show that the proposed plug-in SimOAP strategy improves the backbone models and outperforms the baseline strategies in both automatic and human evaluations.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.553","authors":["Junkai Zhou","Liang Pang","Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","event_ids":["session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5254","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.553.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77119/poster_document/73808feb1fc0767781d6b29bb3bf6af8.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77119/poster/f1a756c97bf9108baeaff73199972a13.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"SimOAP: Improve Coherence and Consistency in Persona-based Dialogue Generation via Over-sampling and Post-evaluation","tldr":"Language models trained on large-scale corpora can generate remarkably fluent results in open-domain dialogue.

Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely used in text-based concept extraction (CE). However, PLMs tend to mine the co-occurrence associations from massive corpus as pre-trained knowledge rather than the real causal effect between tokens. As a result, the pre-trained knowledge confounds PLMs to extract biased concepts based on spurious co-occurrence correlations, inevitably resulting in low precision. In this paper, through the lens of a Structural Causal Model (SCM), we propose equipping the PLM-based extractor with a knowledge-guided prompt as an intervention to alleviate concept bias. The prompt adopts the topic of the given entity from the existing knowledge in KGs to mitigate the spurious co-occurrence correlations between entities and biased concepts. Our extensive experiments on representative multilingual KG datasets justify that our proposed prompt can effectively alleviate concept bias and improve the performance of PLM-based CE models.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.514","authors":["Siyu Yuan","Deqing Yang","Jinxi Liu","Shuyu Tian","Jiaqing Liang","Yanghua Xiao","Rui Xie"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"id":"P526","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.514.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76438/poster_document/404799d4342e6d8c77a3e81da64c246a.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76438/slideshow/988e0a2d266557461835847ebfb34db2.pdf","title":"Causality-aware Concept Extraction based on Knowledge-guided Prompting","tldr":"Concepts benefit natural language understanding but are far from complete in existing knowledge graphs (KGs).

We believe that a better approach is to use a contextual-dependent distribution over the markers to express discourse information.

Such representations can be learned automatically from data without supervision, and in turn provide insights into the data itself.

Previous work has demonstrated that the pre-training in English does not transfer well to other languages in a zero-shot setting. However, multilingual pre-trained language models (MPLM) have excelled at a variety of single-modal language tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to adapt VLP to unseen languages using MPLM.\nWe utilize a cross-lingual contextualised token embeddings alignment approach to train text encoders for non-English languages.

In this paper, we present DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step), a novel approach that further enhances the reasoning capability of language models. DiVeRSe has three main components: first, it generates diverse prompts to explore different reasoning paths for the same question; second, it uses a verifier to filter out incorrect answers based on a weighted voting scheme; and third, it verifies each reasoning step individually instead of the whole chain. We evaluate DiVeRSe on the latest language model code-davinci-002 and show that it achieves new state-of-the-art results on six of eight reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K 74.4\\% to 83.2\\%).","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.291","authors":["Yifei Li","Zeqi Lin","Shizhuo Zhang","Qiang Fu","Bei Chen","Jian-Guang LOU","Weizhu Chen"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5316","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.291.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77125/poster_document/68d3fcf81c32bb194d2e42506c92a2e4.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77125/poster/a19585fed1eae3819b94e19ef60b523f.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Making Language Models Better Reasoners with Step-Aware Verifier","tldr":"Few-shot learning is a challenging task that requires language models to generalize from limited examples.

The social stigma associated with mental illness prevents individuals from addressing their issues and getting assistance.

A counselor should be friendly and gain clients' trust to make them share their problems comfortably. Thus, it is essential for the counselor to adequately comprehend the client's emotions and ensure client's welfare, i.e. s/he should adapt and deal with the clients politely and empathetically to provide a pleasant, cordial and personalized experience. Motivated by this, in this work, we attempt to build a novel Polite and empAthetic counseLing conversational agent PAL to lay down the counseling support to substance addict and crime victims. To have client's emotion-based polite and empathetic responses, two counseling datasets laying down the counseling support to substance addicts and crime victims are annotated. These annotated datasets are used to build PAL in a reinforcement learning framework. A novel reward function is formulated to ensure correct politeness and empathy preferences as per client's emotions with naturalness and non-repetitiveness in responses. Thorough automatic and human evaluation showcase the usefulness and strength of the designed novel reward function.

However, the scripts are always presented in a linear manner, which does not reflect the flexibility displayed by people executing tasks in real life. For example, in the CrossTask Dataset, 64.5\\% of consecutive step pairs are also observed in the reverse order, suggesting their ordering is not fixed. In addition, each step has an average of 2.56 frequent next steps, demonstrating \"branching\". In this paper, we propose the new challenging task of non-sequential graph script induction, aiming to capture optional and interchangeable steps in procedural planning. To automate the induction of such graph scripts for given tasks, we propose to take advantage of loosely aligned videos of people performing the tasks. In particular, we design a multimodal framework to ground procedural videos to WikiHow textual steps and thus transform each video into an observed step path on the latent ground truth graph script. This key transformation enables us to train a script knowledge model capable of both generating explicit graph scripts for learnt tasks and predicting future steps given a partial step sequence. Our best model outperforms the strongest pure text/vision baselines by 17.52\\% absolute gains on F1@3 for next step prediction and 13.8\\% absolute gains on Acc@1 for partial sequence completion.

We perform these experiments for a specific rare-class problem: collecting language samples of cognitive dissonance from social media. We find that PRC is a simple and effective strategy to guide annotations and ultimately improve model accuracy while transfer-learning in a specific order can improve the cold-start performance of the learner but does not benefit iterations of active learning.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.665","authors":["Vasudha Varadarajan","Swanie Juhng","Syeda Mahwish","Xiaoran Liu","Jonah Keith Luby","Christian C.

Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 task families and multiple data domains show that UDR significantly outperforms baselines.

In this work, we present AV-TranSpeech, the first audio-visual speech-to-speech (AV-S2ST) translation model without relying on intermediate text. AV-TranSpeech complements the audio stream with visual information to promote system robustness and opens up a host of practical applications: dictation or dubbing archival films. To mitigate the data scarcity with limited parallel AV-S2ST data, we 1) explore self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled audio-visual data to learn contextual representation, and 2) introduce cross-modal distillation with S2ST models trained on the audio-only corpus to further reduce the requirements of visual data. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate that AV-TranSpeech outperforms audio-only models under all settings regardless of the type of noise. With low-resource audio-visual data (10h, 30h), cross-modal distillation yields an improvement of 7.6 BLEU on average compared with baselines.{Audio samples are available at https://AV-TranSpeech.github.io/.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.479","authors":["Rongjie Huang","Huadai Liu","Xize Cheng","Yi Ren","Linjun Li","Zhenhui Ye","Jinzheng He","Lichao Zhang","Jinglin Liu","Xiang Yin","Zhou Zhao"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Speech and Multimodality","event_ids":["session-7_-speech-and-multimodality-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P555","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.479.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76445/poster_document/2ba8809422ac662f45aeade67600cc45.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76445/poster/00069e55da42ce0ff1e4434e4c5f39ce.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"AV-TranSpeech: Audio-Visual Robust Speech-to-Speech Translation","tldr":"Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert speech from one language into another, and has demonstrated significant progress to date.

We propose a novel statistical model that decomposes the document embeddings into a linear superposition of two vectors; a latent neutral \\emph{context} vector independent of ideology, and a latent \\emph{position} vector aligned with ideology. We train an end-to-end model that has intermediate contextual and positional vectors as outputs.

These methods, such as movement pruning, use first-order information to prune PLMs while fine-tuning the remaining weights. In this work, we argue fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity level. In addition, we also design a new masking function and training objective to further improve SMP. Extensive experiments at various sparsity levels show SMP has significant improvements over first-order and zero-order methods. Unlike previous first-order methods, SMP is also applicable to low sparsity and outperforms zero-order methods. Meanwhile, SMP is more parameter efficient than other methods due to it does not require fine-tuning.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.35","authors":["Ting Jiang","deqing wang","Fuzhen Zhuang","Ruobing Xie","Feng Xia"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-2_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(oral)"],"id":"P5570","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.35.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76348/poster_document/740b7a85d8c2d0ad04fe8be54502e9da.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76348/poster/cce1b06f7dc5216af8011fa04feb1c94.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76348/slideshow/a0ab1a2f8fad13bd89d40d9732e36900.pptx","title":"Pruning Pre-trained Language Models Without Fine-Tuning","tldr":"To overcome the overparameterized problem in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), pruning is widely used as a simple and straightforward compression method by directly removing unimportant weights.

Though deterministic labels generated by averaging or voting are often used as the ground truth, it ignores the intrinsic uncertainty revealed by the inconsistent labels. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach, deep evidential emotion regression (DEER), to estimate the uncertainty in emotion attributes. Treating the emotion attribute labels of an utterance as samples drawn from an unknown Gaussian distribution, DEER places an utterance-specific normal-inverse gamma prior over the Gaussian likelihood and predicts its hyper-parameters using a deep neural network model. It enables a joint estimation of emotion attributes along with the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. AER experiments on the widely used MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP datasets showed DEER produced state-of-the-art results for both the mean values and the distribution of emotion attributes.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.873","authors":["Wen Wu","Chao Zhang","Philip C.

RSTC includes two modules, i.e., pseudo-label generation module and robust representation learning module. The former generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for the later, which contributes to more robust representations and correctly separated clusters. To provide robustness against the imbalance in data, we propose self-adaptive optimal transport in the pseudo-label generation module.

Recent work has aimed to provide textual summaries in the form of concise and salient short texts, i.e., key points (KPs), in a task known as  Key Point Analysis (KPA).  One of the main challenges in KPA is finding high-quality key point candidates from dozens of arguments even in a small corpus.   Furthermore, evaluating key points is crucial in ensuring that the automatically generated summaries are useful.  Although automatic methods for evaluating summarisation have considerably advanced over the years, they mainly focus on sentence-level comparison, making it difficult to measure the quality of a summary (a set of KPs) as a whole. Aggravating this problem is the fact that human evaluation is costly and unreproducible.  To address the above issues, we propose a two-step abstractive summarisation framework based on neural topic modelling with an iterative clustering procedure, to generate key points which are aligned with how humans identify key points. Our experiments show that our framework advances the state of the art in KPA, with performance improvement of up to 14 (absolute) percentage points, in terms of both ROUGE and our own proposed evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated summaries using a novel set-based evaluation toolkit. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics in assessing the quality of generated KPs. Human evaluation further demonstrates the advantages of our approach and validates that our proposed evaluation metric is more consistent with human judgment than ROUGE scores.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.786","authors":["Hao Li","Viktor Schlegel","Riza Batista-Navarro","Goran Nenadic"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","event_ids":["poster-session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"id":"P5576","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.786.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77143/poster_document/461026daf0b1cfe1be9463d66180c53f.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77143/slideshow/0daadd3724ef9f6bc6d225eee13a9104.pptx","title":"Do You Hear The People Sing?

Previous efforts form simile generation as a context-free generation task, focusing on simile-style transfer or writing a simile from a given prefix. \nHowever, generated texts under such settings might be undesirable, such as hardly meeting the simile definition (e.g., missing vehicle) or difficult to address certain preferences of content as humans wish (e.g., describe the color of apples through the simile). We believe that a simile could be more qualified and user-oriented if incorporated with pre-specified constraints. To this end, we introduce controllable simile generation (CSG), a new task that requires the model to generate a simile with multiple simile elements, e.g., context and vehicle. To facilitate this task, we present GraCe, including 61.3k simile-element annotated Chinese similes. Based on it, we propose a CSG model Similor to benchmark this task, including a vehicle retrieval module Scorer to obtain the explicable comparison for a given tenor in the vehicle-unknown situation. Both statistical and experimental analyses show that GraCe is of high quality beyond all other Chinese simile datasets, in terms of the number (8 vs. 3) of annotation elements, Is-Simile accuracy (98.9\\% vs. 78.7\\%), and increasing model-performance gains for both uncontrollable and controllable simile generation. Meanwhile, Similor can serve as a strong baseline for CSG, especially with Scorer, which beats model-based retrieval methods without any re-training.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.28","authors":["Kexin Yang","Dayiheng Liu","Wenqiang Lei","Baosong Yang","Xiangpeng Wei","Zhengyuan Liu","Jun Xie"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-7_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P558","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.28.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76446/poster_document/a57d3da87500a3a76b06cce94e915d01.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Fantastic Expressions and Where to Find Them: Chinese Simile Generation with Multiple Constraints","tldr":"Similes occur in the creative context of describing a concept (i.e., tenor) by making a literally false yet figuratively meaningful comparison to another (i.e., vehicle).

Recent works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.205","authors":["Alexander Scarlatos","Andrew Lan"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"id":"P5580","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.205.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77146/poster_document/c42d568c5261f6ee8279633e502f4494.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77146/poster/30454703470a2bab287bc804d722947f.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Tree-Based Representation and Generation of Natural and Mathematical Language","tldr":"Mathematical language in scientific communications and educational scenarios is important yet relatively understudied compared to natural languages.

Concretely, our randomized positional encoding scheme simulates the positions of longer sequences and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the sequence's length.

One such task is Computer-Assisted Coding (CAC) which has improved significantly in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning technologies. Yet simply predicting a set of final codes for a patient encounter is insufficient as CAC systems are required to provide supporting textual evidence to justify the billing codes. A model able to produce accurate and reliable supporting evidence for each code would be a tremendous benefit. However, a human annotated code evidence corpus is extremely difficult to create because it requires specialized knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MDACE, the first publicly available code evidence dataset, which is built on a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical records. The dataset -- annotated by professional medical coders -- consists of 302 Inpatient charts with 3,934 evidence spans and 52 Profee charts with 5,563 evidence spans. We implemented several evidence extraction methods based on the EffectiveCAN model (Liu et al., 2021) to establish baseline performance on this dataset. MDACE can be used to evaluate code evidence extraction methods for CAC systems, as well as the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models for multi-label classification. We believe that the release of MDACE will greatly improve the understanding and application of deep learning technologies for medical coding and document classification.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.416","authors":["Hua Cheng","Rana Jafari","April D Russell","Russell Klopfer","Edmond Lu","Benjamin R Striner","Matthew R.

In this paper, we utilize simple strategies to annotate entity spans in generations and compare established and novel methods of paraphrasing in NLP such as back translation, specialized encoder-decoder models such as Pegasus, and GPT-3 variants for their effectiveness in improving downstream performance for NER across different levels of gold annotations and paraphrasing strength on 5 datasets. We thoroughly explore the influence of paraphrasers, and dynamics between paraphrasing strength and gold dataset size on the NER performance with visualizations and statistical testing. We find that the choice of the paraphraser greatly impacts NER performance, with one of the larger GPT-3 variants exceedingly capable of generating high quality paraphrases, yielding statistically significant improvements in NER performance with increasing paraphrasing strength, while other paraphrasers show more mixed results. Additionally, inline auto annotations generated by larger GPT-3 are strictly better than heuristic based annotations. We also find diminishing benefits of paraphrasing as gold annotations increase for most datasets. Furthermore, while most paraphrasers promote entity memorization in NER, the proposed GPT-3 configuration performs most favorably among the compared paraphrasers when tested on unseen entities, with memorization reducing further with paraphrasing strength. Finally, we explore mention replacement using GPT-3, which provides additional benefits over base paraphrasing for specific datasets.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.390","authors":["Saket Sharma","Aviral Joshi","Yiyun Zhao","Namrata Mukhija","Hanoz Bhathena","Prateek Singh","Sashank Santhanam"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5603","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.390.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77156/poster_document/3b731691034c60f4306109547c91e8b3.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77156/poster/b3aa74c9630e839ee82d46dd97258438.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77156/slideshow/6335f79cc37741c4e4c2c133c7a374e2.pdf","title":"When and how to paraphrase for named entity recognition?","tldr":"While paraphrasing is a promising approach for data augmentation in classification tasks, its effect on named entity recognition (NER) is not investigated systematically due to the difficulty of span-level label preservation.

However, two pain points persist for this paradigm: (a) as the pre-trained models grow bigger (e.g., 175B parameters for GPT-3), even the fine-tuning process can be time-consuming and computationally expensive; (b) the fine-tuned model has the same size as its starting point by default, which is neither sensible due to its more specialized functionality, nor practical since many fine-tuned models will be deployed in resource-constrained environments. To address these pain points, we propose a framework for resource- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning by leveraging the sparsity prior in both weight updates and the final model weights. Our proposed framework, dubbed Dually Sparsity-Embedded Efficient Tuning (DSEE), aims to achieve two key objectives: (i) parameter efficient fine-tuning -  by enforcing sparsity-aware low-rank updates on top of the pre-trained weights; and (ii) resource-efficient inference - by encouraging a sparse weight structure towards the final fine-tuned model. We leverage sparsity in these two directions by exploiting both unstructured and structured sparse patterns in pre-trained language models via\na unified approach. Extensive experiments and in-depth investigations, with diverse network backbones (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets, consistently demonstrate impressive parameter-/inference-efficiency, while maintaining competitive downstream performance.

The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality,  the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct, a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated conversation from a context.

Despite this, PT has been shown to rely heavily on good initialization of the prompt embeddings. In this work, we study meta prompt tuning (MPT) to systematically explore how meta-learning can help improve (if it can) cross-task generalization in PT through learning to initialize the prompt embeddings from other relevant tasks. We empirically analyze a representative set of meta learning algorithms in a wide range of adaptation settings with different source/target task configurations on a large set of few-shot tasks.

For other kinds of tasks such as question answering, we observe that while MPT can outperform PT in most cases, it does not always outperform multi-task learning.

However, recent works point out that pre-trained language models may memorize a considerable fraction of their training data, leading to the privacy risk of information leakage. In this paper, we propose a method named Ethicist for targeted training data extraction through loss smoothed soft prompting and calibrated confidence estimation, investigating how to recover the suffix in the training data when given a prefix. To elicit memorization in the attacked model, we tune soft prompt embeddings while keeping the model fixed. We further propose a smoothing loss that smooths the loss distribution of the suffix tokens to make it easier to sample the correct suffix. In order to select the most probable suffix from a collection of sampled suffixes and estimate the prediction confidence, we propose a calibrated confidence estimation method, which normalizes the confidence of the generated suffixes with a local estimation. We show that Ethicist significantly improves the extraction performance on a recently proposed public benchmark.

Previous AI research has shown the importance of fundamental and indispensable knowledge of actions, i.e., preconditions and effects. However, traditional methods rely on logical formalization which hinders practical applications. With recent transformer-based language models (LMs), reasoning over text is desirable and seemingly feasible, leading to the question of whether LMs can effectively and efficiently learn to solve RAC problems. We propose four essential RAC tasks as a comprehensive textual benchmark and generate problems in a way that minimizes the influence of other linguistic requirements (e.g., grounding) to focus on RAC. The resulting benchmark, TRAC, encompassing problems of various complexities, facilitates a more granular evaluation of LMs, precisely targeting the structural generalization ability much needed for RAC. Experiments with three high-performing transformers indicate that additional efforts are needed to tackle challenges raised by TRAC.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.255","authors":["Weinan He","Canming Huang","Zhanhao Xiao","Yongmei Liu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Resources and Evaluation","event_ids":["session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P563","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.255.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76447/poster_document/89b0d07cfa86cf1cb2f658563786920a.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76447/slideshow/9715e060082cf2e63d28e4daafca330e.pdf","title":"Exploring the Capacity of Pretrained Language Models for Reasoning about Actions and Change","tldr":"Reasoning about actions and change (RAC) is essential to understand and interact with the ever-changing environment.

However, the result of existing methods is still far from satisfactory. Previous works indicated that omission is a major factor in affecting the quality of summarization, but few of them have further explored the omission problem, such as how omission affects summarization results and how to detect omission, which is critical for reducing omission and improving summarization quality. Moreover, analyzing and detecting omission relies on summarization datasets with omission labels (i.e., which dialogue utterances are omitted in the summarization), which are not available in the current literature. In this paper, we propose the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. By analyzing this dataset, we find that a large improvement in summarization quality can be achieved by providing ground-truth omission labels for the summarization model to recover omission information, which demonstrates the importance of omission detection for omission mitigation in dialogue summarization. Therefore, we formulate an omission detection task and demonstrate our proposed dataset can support the training and evaluation of this task well. We also call for research action on omission detection based on our proposed datasets.

To address these issues, this paper designs a Token-Token Bidirectional Event Completed Graph (TT-BECG) in which the relation eType-Role1-Role2 serves as the edge type, precisely revealing which tokens play argument roles in an event of a specific event type. Exploiting the token-token adjacency matrix of the TT-BECG, we develop an edge-enhanced joint document-level event extraction model. Guided by the target token-token adjacency matrix, the predicted token-token adjacency matrix can be obtained during the model training. Then, extracted events and event records in a document are decoded based on the predicted matrix, including the graph structure and edge type decoding.

This is particularly problematic for less well studied tasks, and for languages other than English. \nThis paper addresses these challenges while focusing on the under-explored task of event extraction from a novel domain of historical texts. We introduce a new multilingual dataset in English, French, and Dutch composed of newspaper ads from the early modern colonial period reporting on enslaved people who liberated themselves from enslavement. We find that: 1) even with scarce annotated data, it is possible to achieve surprisingly good results by formulating the problem as an extractive QA task and leveraging existing datasets and models for modern languages; and 2) cross-lingual low-resource learning for historical languages is highly challenging, and machine translation of the historical datasets to the considered target languages is, in practice, often the best-performing solution.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.574","authors":["Nadav Borenstein","Nat\u00e1lia da Silva Perez","Isabelle Augenstein"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(poster)"],"id":"P5673","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.574.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77188/poster_document/54b058bb9dd166bb23c81f94e14795de.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77188/poster/c23f4efb72aa20be700aa7b64ea15dc3.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Multilingual Event Extraction from Historical Newspaper Adverts","tldr":"NLP methods can aid historians in analyzing textual materials in greater volumes than manually feasible.

However, self-attention suffers from quadratic memory requirements with respect to the sequence length. Existing work focuses on reducing time and space complexity from an algorithm perspective. In this work, we propose sequence parallelism, a memory-efficient parallelism to solve this issue from system perspective instead. Our approach is compatible with most existing parallelisms (e.g., data, pipeline, and tensor parallelism), which means our sequence parallelism makes 4D parallelism possible. More importantly, we no longer require a single device to hold the whole sequence. Besides, using efficient attention with linear complexity, our sequence parallelism enables us to train transformer with infinite long sequence. Specifically, we split the input sequence into multiple chunks and feed each chunk into its corresponding device (i.e., GPU). To compute the attention output, we integrated ring-style communication with self-attention calculation and proposed Ring Self-Attention (RSA). Experiments show that sequence parallelism performs well when scaling with batch size and sequence length. Compared with tensor parallelism, our approach achieved $13.7\\times$ and $3.0\\times$ maximum batch size and sequence length respectively when scaling up to 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. With efficient attention, sequence can handle sequence with over 114K tokens, which is over $27\\times$ longer than existing efficient attention works holding the whole sequence on a single device.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.134","authors":["Shenggui Li","Fuzhao Xue","Chaitanya Baranwal","Yongbin Li","Yang You"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"id":"P5676","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.134.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77189/poster_document/79c79cb26c4f297e0bbb32b54a359fdd.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77189/poster/a4c0ebab082e2c377c7d269e0736e5f1.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77189/slideshow/fe3e22f100ae0480f9258a5b688198ea.pdf","title":"Sequence Parallelism: Long Sequence Training from System Perspective","tldr":"Transformer achieves promising results on various tasks.

Existing work usually utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute classifiers, yet suffer from increases in storage and inference time. To address these concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a parameter-efficient manner. In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector i.e., single-attribute prompt), which guides the generation of a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to satisfy a pre-specified attribute. These prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole for multi-attribute CTG without any re-training. Nevertheless, this may raise problems of fluency downgrading and position sensitivity. To solve this, Tailor provides two solutions to enhance the combination. The former contains a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one single-attribute prompt for each task) and the testing stage (concatenating two prompts). The latter introduces a trainable prompt connector to further enhance the combinations. Experiments demonstrate that, only requiring 0.08\\% extra training parameters of the GPT-2, Tailor can achieve effective and general improvements on eleven attribute-specific generation tasks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.25","authors":["Kexin Yang","Dayiheng Liu","Wenqiang Lei","Baosong Yang","Mingfeng Xue","Boxing Chen","Jun Xie"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Generation","event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5680","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.25.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77192/poster_document/76f535ab46b55f37bec5cc931fd82229.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77192/poster/df209f2aa7e62e186d30822abd0f51ad.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Tailor: A Soft-Prompt-Based Approach to Attribute-Based Controlled Text Generation","tldr":"Attribute-based Controlled Text Generation (CTG) refers to generating sentences that satisfy desirable attributes (e.g., emotions and topics).

Specifically, we categorize PQA studies into four problem settings in terms of the form of provided answers.

Our key distinction is to show how this notion of residual complementarity is limited, and propose a new objective, denoted as RoC (Ratio of Complementarity), which captures a fuller notion of complementarity. We propose a two-level orthogonality designed to improve RoC, then show that the improved RoC of our model, in turn, improves the performance of hybrid retrieval.

Research efforts have been made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency. Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social media, BIC employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further analyses reveal that text-graph interactions and modeling semantic consistency are essential improvements and help combat bot evolution.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.575","authors":["Zhenyu Lei","Herun Wan","Wenqian Zhang","Shangbin Feng","Zilong Chen","Jundong Li","Qinghua Zheng","Minnan Luo"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"id":"P5713","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.575.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77205/poster_document/6716938e382ea58fa082cbc6bd5936ec.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77205/poster/50788c9be7432121a3154c8caeedba0e.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77205/slideshow/c30bdedcf266fb4e9571b14b971b8a20.pdf","title":"BIC: Twitter Bot Detection with Text-Graph Interaction and Semantic Consistency","tldr":"Twitter bots are automatic programs operated by malicious actors to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation.

Existing defenses focus on improving the robustness of the victim model in the training stage. However, they often neglect to proactively mitigate adversarial attacks during inference. Towards this overlooked aspect, we propose a defense framework that aims to mitigate attacks by confusing attackers and correcting adversarial contexts that are caused by malicious perturbations. Our framework comprises three components: (1) a synonym-based transformation to randomly corrupt adversarial contexts in the word level, (2) a developed BERT defender to correct abnormal contexts in the representation level, and (3) a simple detection method to filter out adversarial examples, any of which can be flexibly combined. Additionally, our framework helps improve the robustness of the victim model during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in defending against word-level adversarial attacks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.155","authors":["Zhaoyang Wang","Zhiyue Liu","Xiaopeng Zheng","Qinliang Su","Jiahai Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["session-1_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5723","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.155.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77207/poster_document/d5f30d498b65877b3d12affa7a033743.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77207/poster/3213db5acebabd3889ae9ca674052941.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"RMLM: A Flexible Defense Framework for Proactively Mitigating Word-level Adversarial Attacks","tldr":"Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks keep raising security concerns in natural language processing research.

To this end, we explore a new paradigm \\textit{plug-and-play knowledge injection}, where knowledge bases are injected into frozen existing downstream models by a \\textit{knowledge plugin}. Correspondingly, we propose a plug-and-play injection method \\textit{map-tuning}, which trains a mapping of knowledge embeddings to enrich model inputs with mapped embeddings while keeping model parameters frozen. Experimental results on three knowledge-driven NLP tasks show that existing injection methods are not suitable for the new paradigm, while map-tuning effectively improves the performance of downstream models. Moreover, we show that a frozen downstream model can be well adapted to different domains with different mapping networks of domain knowledge.

Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in code generation. In this paper, we propose ReCode, a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark for code generation models. We customize over 30 transformations specifically for code on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format. They are carefully designed to be natural in real-life coding practice, preserve the original semantic meaning, and thus provide multifaceted assessments of a model's robustness performance. With human annotators, we verified that over 90\\% of the perturbed prompts do not alter the semantic meaning of the original prompt. In addition, we define robustness metrics for code generation models considering the worst-case behavior under each type of perturbation, taking advantage of the fact that executing the generated code can serve as objective evaluation. We demonstrate ReCode on SOTA models using HumanEval, MBPP, as well as function completion tasks derived from them. Interesting observations include: better robustness for CodeGen over InCoder and GPT-J; models are most sensitive to syntax perturbations; more challenging robustness evaluation on MBPP over HumanEval.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.773","authors":["Shiqi Wang","Zheng Li","Haifeng Qian","Chenghao Yang","Zijian Wang","Mingyue Shang","Varun Kumar","Samson Tan","Baishakhi Ray","Parminder Bhatia","Ramesh Nallapati","Murali Krishna Ramanathan","Dan Roth","Bing Xiang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5744","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.773.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77215/poster_document/2664adbc541efeda610e593cf1eb970b.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77215/poster/b05e9ff860aa9b11e44635b08d8e6201.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77215/slideshow/42823ae5fb263a87cd2bc6ac458b5370.pdf","title":"ReCode: Robustness Evaluation of Code Generation Models","tldr":"Code generation models have achieved impressive performance.

It employs a simple bottleneck architecture that learns to compress the passage information into a dense vector through self-supervised pre-training. We use a replaced language modeling objective, which is inspired by ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020), to improve the sample efficiency and reduce the mismatch of the input distribution between pre-training and fine-tuning. SimLM only requires access to an unlabeled corpus and is more broadly applicable when there are no labeled data or queries.

We discover that, to a large extent, the ability to generate instructions does indeed emerge when using a model that is both large enough and aligned to follow instructions; InstructGPT achieves 65.7\\% of human performance in our execution-based metric, while the original GPT-3 model reaches only 9.8\\% of human performance.

In this paper, we propose a multi-stage method, Typed Predicate-Entailment Graph Generator (TP-EGG), to tackle this problem. Given several seed predicates, TP-EGG builds the graphs by generating new predicates and detecting entailment relations among them. The generative nature of TP-EGG helps us leverage the recent advances from large pretrained language models (PLMs), while avoiding the reliance on carefully prepared corpora.

GreenKGC consists of three modules: representation learning, feature pruning, and decision learning, to extract discriminant KG features and make accurate predictions on missing relationships using classifiers and negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that, in low dimensions, GreenKGC can outperform SOTA methods in most datasets. In addition, low-dimensional GreenKGC can achieve competitive or even better performance against high-dimensional models with a much smaller model size.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.591","authors":["Yun Cheng Wang","Xiou Ge","Bin Wang","C.-C.

Most of the earlier studies failed to justify their findings, necessitating the adoption of interpretable models that can explain the model's output in real time. We introduce an explainable complaint dataset, X-CI, the first benchmark dataset for explainable complaint detection. Each instance in the X-CI dataset is annotated with five labels: complaint label, emotion label, polarity label, complaint severity level, and rationale (explainability), i.e., the causal span explaining the reason for the complaint/non-complaint label. We address the task of explainable complaint detection and propose a commonsense-aware unified generative framework by reframing the multitask problem as a text-to-text generation task. Our framework can predict the complaint cause, severity level, emotion, and polarity of the text in addition to detecting whether it is a complaint or not. We further establish the advantages of our proposed model on various evaluation metrics over the state-of-the-art models and other baselines when applied to the X-CI dataset in both full and few-shot settings.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.404","authors":["Apoorva Singh","Raghav Jain","Prince Jha","Sriparna Saha"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Extraction","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"id":"P5767","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.404.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77222/poster_document/2c705e88d41f6c20d89d3600791ddbe9.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77222/poster/ffe6f18715f41afdfa4d89b47648d3c0.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Peeking inside the black box: A Commonsense-aware Generative Framework for Explainable Complaint Detection","tldr":"Complaining is an illocutionary act in which the speaker communicates his/her dissatisfaction with a set of circumstances and holds the hearer (the complainee) answerable, directly or indirectly.

By taking the model's prediction as the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, self-training bootstraps the model with pseudo instances in the target domain. However, the prediction errors of pseudo labels (label noise) challenge the performance of self-training. To address this problem, previous approaches only use reliable pseudo instances, i.e., pseudo instances with high prediction confidence, to retrain the model. Although these strategies effectively reduce the label noise, they are prone to miss the hard examples. In this paper, we propose a new self-training framework for domain adaptation, namely Domain adversarial learning enhanced Self-Training Framework (DaMSTF). Firstly, DaMSTF involves meta-learning to estimate the importance of each pseudo instance, so as to simultaneously reduce the label noise and preserve hard examples. Secondly, we design a meta constructor for constructing the meta-validation set, which guarantees the effectiveness of the meta-learning module by improving the quality of the meta-validation set. Thirdly, we find that the meta-learning module suffers from the training guidance vanish- ment and tends to converge to an inferior optimal. To this end, we employ domain adversarial learning as a heuristic neural network initialization method, which can help the meta-learning module converge to a better optimal. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DaMSTF. On the cross-domain sentiment classification task, DaMSTF improves the performance of BERT with an average of nearly 4\\%.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.92","authors":["Menglong Lu","Zhen Huang","Yunxiang Zhao","Zhiliang Tian","Yang Liu","Dongsheng Li"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-1_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P5777","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.92.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77228/poster_document/754780a90a7f74e6658f13fb2427d9d8.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DaMSTF: Domain Adversarial Learning Enhanced Meta Self-Training for Domain Adaptation","tldr":"Self-training emerges as an important research line on domain adaptation.

In this work, we investigate weakly-supervised spoken video grounding, i.e., learning to localize moments without expensive temporal annotations. To effectively represent the cross-modal semantics, we propose Semantic Interaction Learning (SIL), a novel framework consisting of the acoustic-semantic pre-training (ASP) and acoustic-visual contrastive learning (AVCL). In ASP, we pre-train an effective encoder for the grounding task with three comprehensive tasks, where the robustness task enhances stability by explicitly capturing the invariance between time- and frequency-domain features, the conciseness task avoids over-smooth attention by compressing long sequence into segments, and the semantic task improves spoken language understanding by modeling the precise semantics. In AVCL, we mine pseudo labels with discriminative sampling strategies and directly strengthen the interaction between speech and video by maximizing their mutual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.611","authors":["Ye Wang","Wang Lin","Shengyu Zhang","Tao Jin","Linjun Li","Xize Cheng","Zhou Zhao"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","event_ids":["session-4_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(oral)"],"id":"P5784","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.611.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76355/poster_document/7bec9795405c4dca790bef80cc28cc70.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76355/poster/af263a1ee4eb0b03fc77b61378978872.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76355/slideshow/3572c0a36f6d879c0aec3889cc086d72.pdf","title":"Weakly-Supervised Spoken Video Grounding via Semantic Interaction Learning","tldr":"The task of spoken video grounding aims to localize moments in videos that are relevant to descriptive spoken queries.

However, these tasks often suffer from limited data availability due to the labor-intensive nature of their annotations. Consequently, recent studies have explored knowledge transfer approaches within a multi-task learning framework to address this challenge. Although such methods have achieved acceptable results, such brute-force solutions struggle to effectively transfer event-relational knowledge due to the vast array of inter-event relations (e.g. temporal, causal, conditional) and reasoning formulations (e.g. discriminative, abductive, ending prediction). To enhance knowledge transfer and enable zero-shot generalization among various combinations, in this work we propose a novel unified framework, called UNIEVENT. Inspired by prefix-based multitask learning, our approach organizes event relational reasoning tasks into a coordinate system with multiple axes, representing inter-event relations and reasoning formulations. We then train a unified text-to-text generative model that utilizes coordinate-assigning prefixes for each task.

Their affinity for evolving across politics, history, and sociocultural phenomena renders them an ideal vehicle for communication. To comprehend the subtle message conveyed within a meme, one must understand the relevant background that facilitates its holistic assimilation. Besides digital archiving of memes and their metadata by a few websites like knowyourmeme.com, currently, there is no efficient way to deduce a meme's context dynamically. In this work, we propose a novel task, MEMEX - given a meme and a related document, the aim is to mine the context that succinctly explains the background of the meme. At first, we develop MCC (Meme Context Corpus), a novel dataset for MEMEX. Further, to benchmark MCC, we propose MIME (MultImodal Meme Explainer), a multimodal neural framework that uses external knowledge-enriched meme representation and a multi-level approach to capture the cross-modal semantic dependencies between the meme and the context. MIME surpasses several unimodal and multimodal systems and yields an absolute improvement of ~ 4\\% F1-score over the best baseline. Lastly, we conduct detailed analyses of MIME's performance, highlighting the aspects that could lead to optimal modeling of cross-modal contextual associations.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.289","authors":["Shivam Sharma","Ramaneswaran S","Udit Arora","Md.

When entity spans overlap between each other, the task is named as nested NER. Span-based methods have been widely used to tackle nested NER. Most of these methods get a score matrix, where each entry corresponds to a span. However, previous work ignores spatial relations in the score matrix. In this paper, we propose using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model these spatial relations. Despite being simple, experiments in three commonly used nested NER datasets show that our model surpasses several recently proposed methods with the same pre-trained encoders. Further analysis shows that using CNN can help the model find more nested entities. Besides, we find that different papers use different sentence tokenizations for the three nested NER datasets, which will influence the comparison.

We introduce Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic Dialogue Structure Induction (NEUPSL DSI), a principled approach that injects symbolic knowledge into the latent space of a generative neural model. We conduct a thorough empirical investigation on the effect of NEUPSL DSI learning on hidden representation quality, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization performance.

We ask humans to label these problems out of 1600 English summaries produced by 16 diverse extractive systems. We find that 30\\% of the summaries have at least one of the five issues. To automatically detect these problems, we find that 5 existing faithfulness evaluation metrics for summarization have poor correlations with human judgment. To remedy this, we propose a new metric, ExtEval, that is designed for detecting unfaithful extractive summaries and is shown to have the best performance.

For high-stake domains that are also knowledge-rich, we show how to use knowledge to (a) identify which rare tokens that appear in both source and reference are important and (b) uplift their conditional probability. We introduce the ``utilization rate'' that encodes knowledge and serves as a regularizer by maximizing the marginal probability of selected tokens.

We verify that, in our dataset, specific medical concepts with high utilization rates are underestimated by conventionally trained sequence-to-sequence models.

By providing poisoned training data, the adversary can embed a \"backdoor\" into the victim model, which allows input instances satisfying certain textual patterns (e.g., containing a keyword) to be predicted as a target label of the adversary's choice. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a backdoor attack that is both stealthy (i.e., hard to notice) and effective (i.e., has a high attack success rate). We propose BITE, a backdoor attack that poisons the training data to establish strong correlations between the target label and a set of \"trigger words\". These trigger words are iteratively identified and injected into the target-label instances through natural word-level perturbations. The poisoned training data instruct the victim model to predict the target label on inputs containing trigger words, forming the backdoor. Experiments on four text classification datasets show that our proposed attack is significantly more effective than baseline methods while maintaining decent stealthiness, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data. We further propose a defense method named DeBITE based on potential trigger word removal, which outperforms existing methods in defending against BITE and generalizes well to handling other backdoor attacks.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.725","authors":["Jun Yan","Vansh Gupta","Xiang Ren"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P5848","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.725.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77247/poster_document/aaf2ed317dbed3ca3233c2241026e66c.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77247/poster/f6aa68e9541479b580b137d04d9f9510.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77247/slideshow/40dcc785a90173cfe447c6a3aec6696a.pdf","title":"BITE: Textual Backdoor Attacks with Iterative Trigger Injection","tldr":"Backdoor attacks have become an emerging threat to NLP systems.

Previously, those tasks were solved with different models because of diverse task output structures. Through re-examining IE tasks, we find that all of them can be interpreted as extracting spans and span relations. They can further be decomposed into token-pair classification tasks by using the start and end token of a span to pinpoint the span, and using the start-to-start and end-to-end token pairs of two spans to determine the relation.

Specifically, it models axis-aware interaction with plus-shaped self-attention and local interaction with Convolutional Neural Network over token pairs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms task-specific and unified models on all tasks in 10 datasets, and achieves better or comparable results on 2 joint IE datasets.

Although efforts have been made to introduce phonetic information (Hanyu Pinyin) in this task, they typically merge phonetic representations with character representations, which tends to weaken the representation effect of normal texts. In this work, we propose to disentangle the two types of features to allow for direct interaction between textual and phonetic information. To learn useful phonetic representations, we introduce a pinyin-to-character objective to ask the model to predict the correct characters based solely on phonetic information, where a separation mask is imposed to disable attention from phonetic input to text. To avoid overfitting the phonetics, we further design a self-distillation module to ensure that semantic information plays a major role in the prediction. Extensive experiments on three CSC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method in using phonetic information.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.755","authors":["Zihong Liang","Xiaojun Quan","Qifan Wang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"NLP Applications","event_ids":["session-7_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P589","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.755.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76454/poster_document/7b854e6a37d22cc0b888e4c5a4d48351.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Disentangled Phonetic Representation for Chinese Spelling Correction","tldr":"Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous characters in Chinese texts.

Although some recent works have proposed to embed hyper-relational KGs, these methods fail to capture essential inference patterns of hyper-relational facts such as qualifier monotonicity, qualifier implication, and qualifier mutual exclusion, limiting their generalization capability. To unlock this, we present ShrinkE, a geometric hyper-relational KG embedding method aiming to explicitly model these patterns. ShrinkE models the primal triple as a spatial-functional transformation from the head into a relation-specific box. Each qualifier ``shrinks'' the box to narrow down the possible answer set and, thus, realizes qualifier monotonicity. The spatial relationships between the qualifier boxes allow for modeling core inference patterns of qualifiers such as implication and mutual exclusion.

Among various existing techniques, multi-task learning is one of the effective ways to share knowledge between ST and MT in which additional MT data can help to learn source-to-target mapping. However, due to the differences between speech and text, there is always a gap between ST and MT. In this paper, we first aim to understand this modality gap from the target-side representation differences, and link the modality gap to another well-known problem in neural machine translation: exposure bias. We find that the modality gap is relatively small during training except for some difficult cases, but keeps increasing during inference due to the cascading effect. To address these problems, we propose the Cross-modal Regularization with Scheduled Sampling (Cress) method. Specifically, we regularize the output predictions of ST and MT, whose target-side contexts are derived by sampling between ground truth words and self-generated words with a varying probability. Furthermore, we introduce token-level adaptive training which assigns different training weights to target tokens to handle difficult cases with large modality gaps. Experiments and analysis show that our approach effectively bridges the modality gap, and achieves significant improvements over a strong baseline in all eight directions of the MuST-C dataset.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.884","authors":["Qingkai Fang","Yang Feng"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-1_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P612","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.884.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76463/poster_document/2d5cb0670a41df1936cc234673f16e48.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Understanding and Bridging the Modality Gap for Speech Translation","tldr":"How to achieve better end-to-end speech translation (ST) by leveraging (text) machine translation (MT) data?

Recently, contrastive learning has been widely adopted which derives high-quality sentence representations by pulling similar semantics closer and pushing dissimilar ones away. However, these methods fail to capture the fine-grained ranking information among the sentences, where each sentence is only treated as either positive or negative. In many real-world scenarios, one needs to distinguish and rank the sentences based on their similarities to a query sentence, e.g., very relevant, moderate relevant, less relevant, irrelevant, etc.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, RankCSE, for unsupervised sentence representation learning, which incorporates ranking consistency and ranking distillation with contrastive learning into a unified framework. In particular, we learn semantically discriminative sentence representations by simultaneously ensuring ranking consistency between two representations with different dropout masks, and distilling listwise ranking knowledge from the teacher. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on both semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over several state-of-the-art baselines.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.771","authors":["Jiduan Liu","Jiahao Liu","Qifan Wang","Jingang Wang","Wei Wu","Yunsen Xian","Dongyan Zhao","Kai Chen","Rui Yan"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-6_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(oral)"],"id":"P624","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.771.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76193/poster_document/7743ed3adeeacd5277264571e6bb0b77.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76193/poster/6b9f56d8af787c2ec40a609f918f30ef.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76193/slideshow/44e50aa3d6f80d52028563049edfb62f.pdf","title":"RankCSE: Unsupervised Sentence Representations Learning via Learning to Rank","tldr":"Unsupervised sentence representation learning is one of the fundamental problems in natural language processing with various downstream applications.

Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness---the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives---generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multi-objective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.100","authors":["Yufei Li","Zexin Li","Yingfan Gao","Cong Liu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P650","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.100.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76468/poster_document/080730288660b90c1eca809d94ee7c26.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"White-Box Multi-Objective Adversarial Attack on Dialogue Generation","tldr":"Pre-trained transformers are popular in state-of-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems.

In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that the ability of a large language model to in-context learn-perform a task is not uniformly spread across all of its underlying components. Using a 66 billion parameter language model (OPT-66B) across a diverse set of 14 downstream tasks, we find this is indeed the case: ~70\\% of the attention heads and ~20\\% of the feed forward networks can be removed with minimal decline in task performance. We find substantial overlap in the set of attention heads (un)important for in-context learning across tasks and number of in-context examples. We also address our hypothesis through a task-agnostic lens, finding that a small set of attention heads in OPT-66B score highly on their ability to perform primitive induction operations associated with in-context learning, namely, prefix matching and copying.

In this work, we present a theoretical analysis where all parameters of a trained Transformer are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space, that is, the space of vocabulary items they operate on. We derive a simple theoretical framework to support our arguments and provide ample evidence for its validity. First, an empirical analysis showing that parameters of both pretrained and fine-tuned models can be interpreted in embedding space. Second, we present two applications of our framework: (a) aligning the parameters of different models that share a vocabulary, and (b) constructing a classifier without training by ``translating'' the parameters of a fine-tuned classifier to parameters of a different model that was only pretrained. Overall, our findings open the door to interpretation methods that, at least in part, abstract away from model specifics and operate in the embedding space only.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.893","authors":["Guy Dar","Mor Geva","Ankit Gupta","Jonathan Berant"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P676","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.893.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76472/poster/731a17f958dc031d29548e05df58bdd0.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Analyzing Transformers in Embedding Space","tldr":"Understanding Transformer-based models has attracted significant attention, as they lie at the heart of recent technological advances across machine learning.

We present NBR, which converts biomedical RE as natural language inference formulation through indirect supervision. By converting relations to natural language hypotheses, NBR is capable of exploiting semantic cues to alleviate annotation scarcity. By incorporating a ranking-based loss that implicitly calibrates abstinent instances, NBR learns a clearer decision boundary and is instructed to abstain on uncertain instances. Extensive experiments on three widely-used biomedical RE benchmarks, namely ChemProt, DDI and GAD, verify the effectiveness of NBR in both full-set and low-resource regimes.

Therefore, mPMR acquires better NLU capability for target languages. mPMR also provides a unified solver for tackling cross-lingual span extraction and sequence classification, thereby enabling the extraction of rationales to explain the sentence-pair classification process.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.131","authors":["Weiwen Xu","Xin Li","Wai Lam","Lidong Bing"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-1_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P713","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.131.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76478/poster_document/a91aefb8fb69ffe2d540fb9ad411ae37.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76478/poster/cc4e654046afe34458be4fb8e2166d0d.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"mPMR: A Multilingual Pre-trained Machine Reader at Scale","tldr":"We present multilingual Pre-trained Machine Reader (mPMR), a novel method for multilingual machine reading comprehension (MRC)-style pre-training. mPMR aims to guide multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) to perform natural language understanding (NLU) including both sequence classificatio...","track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","underline_id":76478,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/events/395/posters/15197/poster/76478-breeding-machine-translations-evolutionary-approach-to-survive-and-thrive-in-the-world-of-automated-evaluation","video_url":null},{"abstract":"State-of-the-art target-oriented opinion word extraction (TOWE) models typically use BERT-based text encoders that operate on the word level, along with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that incorporate syntactic information extracted from syntax trees.

To enhance TOWE performance, we tackle the issue of aspect representation loss during encoding. Instead of solely utilizing a sentence as the input, we use a sentence-aspect pair.

Additionally, certain groups, such as non-binary people and non-native English speakers, are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks.

In this task, as well as broader language generation tasks, the generation of a nonfactual description (factual error) versus an incongruous description (contextual error) is fundamentally different, yet often conflated. We develop an evaluation paradigm that enables us to disentangle these two types of errors in naturally occurring textual contexts. We find that factuality and congruity are often at odds, and that models specifically struggle with accurate descriptions of entities that are less familiar to people.

On downstream tasks, the pre-trained prompts are selectively activated and combined, leading to strong compositional generalization to unseen tasks. To bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, we formulate upstream and downstream tasks into a unified machine reading comprehension task. Extensive experiments under two learning paradigms, i.e., gradient descent and black-box tuning, show that MP2 significantly outperforms prompt tuning, full model tuning, and prior prompt pre-training methods in few-shot settings. In addition, we demonstrate that MP2 can achieve surprisingly fast and strong adaptation to downstream tasks by merely learning 8 parameters to combine the pre-trained modular prompts.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.625","authors":["Tianxiang Sun","Zhengfu He","Qin Zhu","Xipeng Qiu","Xuanjing Huang"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Learning for NLP","event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P813","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.625.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76490/poster_document/7c491ffecf95c88774d61f6d58bd5c8c.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76490/slideshow/abefb6bd479c9d2a584773066663addc.pdf","title":"Multitask Pre-training of Modular Prompt for Chinese Few-Shot Learning","tldr":"Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient approach to adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks.

However, these plans usually only contain the major observations from the radiographs (e.g., lung opacity), lacking much necessary information, such as the observation characteristics and preliminary clinical diagnoses. To address this problem, the system should also take the image information into account together with the textual plan and perform stronger reasoning during the generation process. In this paper, we propose an Observation-guided radiology Report Generation framework (ORGan). It first produces an observation plan and then feeds both the plan and radiographs for report generation, where an observation graph and a tree reasoning mechanism are adopted to precisely enrich the plan information by capturing the multi-formats of each observation.

Despite rapid recent progress afforded by increasingly better pre-trained language models (PLMs), current PLM research practices often conflate different possible sources of model improvement, without conducting proper ablation studies and principled comparisons between different models under comparable conditions. These practices (i) leave us ill-equipped to understand which pre-training approaches should be used under what circumstances; (ii) impede reproducibility and credit assignment; and (iii) render it difficult to understand: \"How exactly does each factor contribute to the progress that we have today?'' We provide a case in point by revisiting the success of BERT over its baselines, ELMo and GPT-1, and demonstrate how --- under comparable conditions where the baselines are tuned to a similar extent --- these baselines (and even-simpler variants thereof) can, in fact, achieve competitive or better performance than BERT. These findings demonstrate how disentangling different factors of model improvements can lead to valuable new insights. We conclude with recommendations for how to encourage and incentivize this line of work, and accelerate progress towards a better and more systematic understanding of what factors drive the progress of our foundation models today.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.477","authors":["Made Nindyatama Nityasya","Haryo Akbarianto Wibowo","Alham Fikri Aji","Genta Indra Winata","Radityo Eko Prasojo","Phil Blunsom","Adhiguna Kuncoro"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Theme: Reality Check","event_ids":["session-2_-theme_-reality-check-(oral)"],"id":"P834","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.477.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76204/poster_document/079260769a6bbab561337930de0369ca.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76204/poster/51e45aa70fe91c7025280fbb0d6dbd96.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"On \"Scientific Debt\" in NLP: A Case for More Rigour in Language Model Pre-Training Research","tldr":"This evidence-based position paper critiques current research practices within the language model pre-training literature.

BLASER leverages a multilingual multimodal encoder to directly encode the speech segments for source input, translation output and reference into a shared embedding space and computes a score of the translation quality that can be used as a proxy to human evaluation. To evaluate our approach, we construct training and evaluation sets from more than 40k human annotations covering seven language directions.\n\nThe best results of BLASER are achieved by training with supervision from human rating scores. We show that when evaluated at the sentence level, BLASER correlates significantly better with human judgment compared to ASR dependent metrics including ASR-SENTBLEU in all translation directions and ASR-COMET in five of them. Our analysis shows combining speech and text as inputs to BLASER does not increase the correlation with human scores, but best correlations are achieved when using speech, which motivates the goal of our research.

However, vanilla fine-tuning easily overfits the target data and degrades the generalization ability. Most existing studies attribute it to catastrophic forgetting, and they retain the pre-trained knowledge indiscriminately without identifying what knowledge is transferable. Motivated by this, we frame fine-tuning into a causal graph and discover that the crux of catastrophic forgetting lies in the missing causal effects from the pre-trained data.  Based on the causal view, we propose a unified objective for fine-tuning to retrieve the causality back. Intriguingly, the unified objective can be seen as the sum of the vanilla fine-tuning objective, which learns new knowledge from target data, and the causal objective, which preserves old knowledge from PLMs. Therefore, our method is flexible and can mitigate negative transfer while preserving knowledge. Since endowing models with commonsense is a long-standing challenge, we implement our method on commonsense QA with a proposed heuristic estimation to verify its effectiveness. In the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on all six commonsense QA datasets and can be implemented as a plug-in module to inflate the performance of existing QA models.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.509","authors":["Junhao Zheng","Qianli Ma","Shengjie Qiu","Yue Wu","Peitian Ma","Junlong Liu","Huawen Feng","Xichen Shang","Haibin Chen"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-3_-large-language-models-(oral)"],"id":"P868","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.509.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76206/poster_document/4154a0f9240129a20ec1c2465b40e2a8.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76206/poster/c93a1947db4a9ddfda42fdad88956ed2.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76206/slideshow/7a9614bb0e2f3b4f6e02bfb7e3bd7ba0.pdf","title":"Preserving Commonsense Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models via Causal Inference","tldr":"Fine-tuning has been proven to be a simple and effective technique to transfer the learned knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks.

The more faithful a FA is, the more accurately it reflects which parts of the input are more important for the prediction. Widely used faithfulness metrics, such as sufficiency and comprehensiveness use a hard erasure criterion, i.e. entirely removing or retaining the top most important tokens ranked by a given FA and observing the changes in predictive likelihood. However, this hard criterion ignores the importance of each individual token, treating them all equally for computing sufficiency and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective soft erasure criterion. Instead of entirely removing or retaining tokens from the input, we randomly mask parts of the token vector representations proportionately to their FA importance. Extensive experiments across various natural language processing tasks and different FAs show that our soft-sufficiency and soft-comprehensiveness metrics consistently prefer more faithful explanations compared to hard sufficiency and comprehensiveness.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.261","authors":["Zhixue Zhao","Nikolaos Aletras"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["session-3_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(oral)"],"id":"P895","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.261.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76208/poster_document/fdf67ef9c0c7a296f533f723bd08d3c2.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76208/poster/067491006b101fd34baeffa41904309a.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Incorporating Attribution Importance for Improving Faithfulness Metrics","tldr":"Feature attribution methods (FAs) are popular approaches for providing insights into the model reasoning process of making predictions.

While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.883","authors":["Uri Shaham","Maha Elbayad","Vedanuj Goswami","Omer Levy","Shruti Bhosale"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Machine Translation","event_ids":["session-6_-machine-translation-(oral)"],"id":"P899","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.883.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76209/poster_document/5459669b138bfac8ccf2442195f1f2b5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76209/poster/4e14fef6364a55ab68d57edd2a1f1dfe.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Causes and Cures for Interference in Multilingual Translation","tldr":"Multilingual machine translation models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs, but also suffer from interference.

For example, persuading someone to reconsider smoking might involve empathetic, well founded arguments based on facts and expert opinions about its ill-effects and the consequences on one's family. However, the automatic generation of high-quality factual arguments can be challenging. Addressing existing controllability issues can make the recent advances in computational models for argument generation a potential solution. In this paper, we introduce ArgU: a neural argument generator capable of producing factual arguments from input facts and real-world concepts that can be explicitly controlled for stance and argument structure using Walton's argument scheme-based control codes. Unfortunately, computational argument generation is a relatively new field and lacks datasets conducive to training. Hence, we have compiled and released an annotated corpora of 69,428 arguments spanning six topics and six argument schemes, making it the largest publicly available corpus for identifying argument schemes; the paper details our annotation and dataset creation framework. We further experiment with an argument generation strategy that establishes an inference strategy by generating an ``argument template'' before actual argument generation. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically generate diverse arguments exhibiting different inference patterns for the same set of facts by using control codes based on argument schemes and stance.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.466","authors":["Sougata Saha","Rohini K Srihari"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"id":"P909","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.466.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76504/poster_document/27f66a978a0a08a39228a559e9077375.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"ArgU: A Controllable Factual Argument Generator","tldr":"Effective argumentation is essential towards a purposeful conversation with a satisfactory outcome.

Advances in automated event extraction have yielded massive data sets of \"who did what to whom\" micro-records that enable data-driven approaches to monitoring conflict. The Goldstein scale is a widely-used expert-based measure that scores events on a conflictual\u2013cooperative scale. It is based only on the action category (\"what\") and disregards the subject (\"who\") and object (\"to whom\") of an event, as well as contextual information, like associated casualty count, that should contribute to the perception of an event's \"intensity\". This paper takes a latent variable-based approach to measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model that assumes each observed event is associated with a latent intensity class. A novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such that higher-valued classes denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal nature of the latent variable is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher intensity. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that it obtains comparatively good held-out predictive performance.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.265","authors":["Niklas Stoehr","Lucas Torroba Hennigen","Josef Valvoda","Robert West","Ryan Cotterell","Aaron Schein"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","event_ids":["poster-session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"id":"P927","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.265.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76507/poster_document/45493d23e95304126807eae113d34901.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76507/slideshow/327ccc316dfdd38ed4ac032b8862a941.pdf","title":"An Ordinal Latent Variable Model of Conflict Intensity","tldr":"Measuring the intensity of events is crucial for monitoring and tracking armed conflict.

Unstructured clinical notes, which contain a vast amount of information, are a valuable resource for electronic phenotyping. However, traditional methods, such as rule-based labeling functions or neural networks, require significant manual effort to tune and may not generalize well to multiple indications. To address these challenges, we propose \\textit{HyDE} (hybrid diagnosis extractor). HyDE is a simple framework for electronic phenotyping that integrates labeling functions and a disease-agnostic neural network to assign diagnoses to patients. By training HyDE's model to correct predictions made by labeling functions, we are able to disambiguate hypertension true positives and false positives with a supervised area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.85. We extend this hypertension-trained model to zero-shot evaluation of four other diseases, generating AUPRC values ranging from 0.82 - 0.95 and outperforming a labeling function baseline by 44 points in F1 score and a Word2Vec baseline by 24 points in F1 score on average. Furthermore, we demonstrate a speedup of >4x by pruning the length of inputs into our language model to  ~2.3\\% of the full clinical notes, with negligible impact to the AUPRC.

Compared to the previous efforts which only predict generic comments to news, the proposed task not only introduces personalization in the modeling but also predicts the sentiment polarity and intensity of each response. This enables more accurate and comprehensive inference on the mental state of the persona. Meanwhile, the generated sentiment dimensions make the evaluation and application more reliable.

The empirical results suggest that the included persona attributes are helpful for the performance of all response dimensions. Our analysis shows that the best-performing models are capable of predicting responses that are consistent with the personas, and as a byproduct, the task formulation also enables many interesting applications in the analysis of social network groups and their opinions, such as the discovery of extreme opinion groups.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.48","authors":["Chenkai Sun","Jinning Li","Hou Pong Chan","ChengXiang Zhai","Heng Ji"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics","event_ids":["poster-session-2_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(poster)"],"id":"P959","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-short.48.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76512/poster_document/bcd541f386d57e3b70bf3b62948427ba.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76512/slideshow/171ad36c447d88888fb14cac1d1d4173.pdf","title":"Measuring the Effect of Influential Messages on Varying Personas","tldr":"Predicting how a user responds to news events enables important applications such as allowing intelligent agents or content producers to estimate the effect on different communities and revise unreleased messages to prevent unexpected bad outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury.

Adversarial attacks have proven to be an important tool to help evaluate the Achilles' heel of the victim models. In this study, we explore the fundamental problem of developing attack models based on logic formalism. We propose NatLogAttack to perform systematic attacks centring around natural logic, a classical logic formalism that is traceable back to Aristotle's syllogism and has been closely developed for natural language inference. The proposed framework renders both label-preserving and label-flipping attacks.\nWe show that compared to the existing attack models, NatLogAttack generates better adversarial examples with fewer visits to the victim models. The victim models are found to be more vulnerable under the label-flipping setting. NatLogAttack provides a tool to probe the existing and future NLI models' capacity from a key viewpoint and we hope more logic-based attacks will be further explored for understanding the desired property of reasoning.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.554","authors":["Zi'ou Zheng","Xiaodan Zhu"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference, and Other Areas","event_ids":["poster-session-6_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(poster)"],"id":"P965","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.554.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76513/poster_document/908c2cc37ff2136a729a4ed9eafce9ed.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76513/slideshow/81a921a2cff0a783c396d793906d50cc.pdf","title":"NatLogAttack: A Framework for Attacking Natural Language Inference Models with Natural Logic","tldr":"Reasoning has been a central topic in artificial intelligence from the beginning.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense retrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained expression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching signal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and two unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint in training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit balance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level view and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a fine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage representation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching information from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR show that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval training methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to improve its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead and target domain data.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.365","authors":["Shicheng Xu","Liang Pang","Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Information Retrieval and Text Mining","event_ids":["session-7_-information-retrieval-and-text-mining-(oral)"],"id":"P971","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.365.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76215/poster_document/922460a112df837680bb5fd7cc0f2240.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76215/poster/e631173f81b56ddae3edb71cc1f6f4e5.jpg","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"BERM: Training the Balanced and Extractable Representation for Matching to Improve Generalization Ability of Dense Retrieval","tldr":"Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when trained on in-domain labeled datasets.

However, recent studies show that even the more advanced LLMs fail in scenarios that require reasoning over multiple objects or facts and making sequences of logical deductions. We propose a two-stage probabilistic inference paradigm, ThinkSum, which reasons over sets of objects or facts in a structured manner. In the first stage (Think -- retrieval of associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum -- probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the possibilities and advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of LLM evaluation tasks, achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on thirteen difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We also compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. Our results suggest that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design, yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs. Overall, our proposed paradigm represents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.68","authors":["Batu M Ozturkler","Nikolay Malkin","Zhen Wang","Nebojsa Jojic"],"category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Large Language Models","event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"id":"P987","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.68.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Poster","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76515/poster_document/fcee91a7ddc9f217bae6d69a6a072356.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76515/slideshow/c4dcd2c6423c5bbbd576162ed0bbb058.pdf","title":"ThinkSum: Probabilistic reasoning over sets using large language models","tldr":"Large language models (LLMs) have a substantial capacity for high-level analogical reasoning: reproducing patterns in linear text that occur in their training data (zero-shot evaluation) or in the provided context (few-shot in-context learning).

Using the probabilistic linear context-free rewriting system (LCFRS) formalism, our approach fixes the rule structure in advance and focuses on parameter learning with maximum likelihood.  To reduce the computational complexity of both parsing and parameter estimation, we restrict the grammar formalism to LCFRS-2 (i.e., binary LCFRS with fan-out two) and further discard  rules that require O(l\\^6) time to parse, reducing inference to  O(l\\^5). We find that using a large number of nonterminals is beneficial and thus make use of tensor decomposition-based rank-space dynamic programming with an embedding-based parameterization of rule probabilities to scale up the number of nonterminals. Experiments on German and Dutch show that our approach is able to induce  linguistically meaningful trees with continuous and discontinuous structures.","anthology_url":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.316","authors":["Songlin Yang","Roger Levy","Yoon Kim"],"category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"display_track":"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing","event_ids":["session-2_-syntax_-tagging,-chunking,-and-parsing-(oral)"],"id":"P989","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":"https://preview.aclanthology.org/acl-23-ingestion/2023.acl-long.316.pdf","paper_type":"Main-Oral","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76216/poster_document/a509fd137bf67cee3f9760e5fefd1b13.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76216/poster/712d372d552c02dbce61d1a2d3c038fa.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76216/slideshow/41eaf6f51410ed1b67a8266dbb2282af.pdf","title":"Unsupervised Discontinuous Constituency Parsing with Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammars","tldr":"We study grammar induction with mildly context-sensitive grammars for unsupervised discontinuous parsing.

A main challenge is the expensive annotation costs and the annotation bias. In this work, we study video sentence localization in a zero-shot setting, which learns with only video data without any annotation. Existing zero-shot pipelines usually generate event proposals and then generate a pseudo query for each event proposal. However, their event proposals are obtained via visual feature clustering, which is query-independent and inaccurate; and the pseudo-queries are short or less interpretable. Moreover, existing approaches ignores the risk of pseudo-label noise when leveraging them in training. To address the above problems, we propose a Structure-based Pseudo Label generation (SPL), which first generate free-form interpretable pseudo queries before constructing query-dependent event proposals by modeling the event temporal structure. To mitigate the effect of pseudo-label noise, we propose a noise-resistant iterative method that repeatedly re-weight the training sample based on noise estimation to train a grounding model and correct pseudo labels. Experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach.
