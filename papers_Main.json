This calls for a secure watermarking system to guarantee copyright protection through leakage tracing or ownership identification. To effectively combat piracy and protect copyrights, a multi-bit watermarking framework should be able to embed adequate bits of information and extract the watermarks in a robust manner despite possible corruption. In this work, we explore ways to advance both payload and robustness by following a well-known proposition from image watermarking and identify features in natural language that are invariant to minor corruption.

This work proposes a more realistic end-to-end domain shift evaluation setting covering five diverse domains. We not only find that end-to-end models fail to generalize but that high retrieval scores often still yield poor answer prediction accuracy. To address these failures, we investigate several interventions, in the form of data augmentations, for improving model adaption and use our evaluation set to elucidate the relationship between the efficacy of an intervention scheme and the particular type of dataset shifts we consider. We propose a generalizability test that estimates the type of shift in a target dataset without training a model in the target domain and that the type of shift is predictive of which data augmentation schemes will be effective for domain adaption. Overall, we find that these interventions increase end-to-end performance by up to ~24 points.","authors":["DheeruDua","EmmaStrubell","SameerSingh","PatVerga"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-question-answering-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P1022","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76217/poster_document/4ae5c89fc3f720d14c90dd0f6e315ad2.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76217/poster/e8ab469e0e837ac11054f9e604efbff1.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"To Adapt or to Annotate: Challenges and Interventions for Domain Adaptation in Open-Domain Question Answering","tldr":"Recent advances in open-domain question answering (ODQA) have demonstrated impressive accuracy on general-purpose domains like Wikipedia.

To solve it, we create a new challenging test set of English-German, increasing the average constraint count per sentence from 1.1$\\sim$1.7 to 6.1 and the length per target constraint from 1.1$\\sim$1.2 words to 3.4 words.

Based on these observations, we propose a simple but effective method combining the advantages of PH and CS. This approach involves training a model like PH to predict the term labels, and then during inference replacing those labels with target terminology text like CS, so that the subsequent generation is aware of the target term content.

Second, they only consider tables of limited types and ignore other tables especially complex tables with flexible header locations. Such simplified problem setting cannot cover practical scenarios where models need to process tables without header annotations in the inference phase or tables of different types. To address above issues, we construct a new TQA dataset with implicit and multi-type table structures, named IM-TQA, which not only requires the model to understand tables without directly available header annotations but also to handle multi-type tables including previously neglected complex tables.

Recently, there is a growing trend of applying prompts on pre-trained language models (PLMs), which has exhibited effectiveness in the few-shot flat text classification tasks. However, limited work has studied the paradigm of prompt-based learning in the HTC problem when the training data is extremely scarce. In this work, we define a path-based few-shot setting and establish a strict path-based evaluation metric to further explore few-shot HTC tasks. To address the issue, we propose the hierarchical verbalizer (\"HierVerb\"), a multi-verbalizer framework treating HTC as a single- or multi-label classification problem at multiple layers and learning vectors as verbalizers constrained by hierarchical structure and hierarchical contrastive learning. In this manner, HierVerb fuses label hierarchy knowledge into verbalizers and remarkably outperforms those who inject hierarchy through graph encoders, maximizing the benefits of PLMs. Extensive experiments on three popular HTC datasets under the few-shot settings demonstrate that prompt with HierVerb significantly boosts the HTC performance, meanwhile indicating an elegant way to bridge the gap between the large pre-trained model and downstream hierarchical classification tasks.","authors":["KeJi","YixinLian","JingshengGao","BaoyuanWang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1071","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76524/poster_document/77890bb65c8a318339108c9516d76a01.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76524/poster/ad5c072ff86a7cdf02e3b84866a1a738.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Hierarchical Verbalizer for Few-Shot Hierarchical Text Classification","tldr":"Due to the complex label hierarchy and intensive labeling cost in practice, the hierarchical text classification (HTC) suffers a poor performance especially when low-resource or few-shot settings are ...","track":"Large Language Models","underline_id":76524,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76524-hierarchical-verbalizer-for-few-shot-hierarchical-text-classification","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52263/file/57fea8b00af1ec56af744fd93308f781.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085045Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=bfc000f8010c05ec0589b1b1b2677eb7deb238b3d76ef52b3fd338a6c9711fe2"},{"abstract":"Recent works have shown that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit language models to solve complex reasoning tasks, step-by-step.

Enriching the fine-tuning data with such diverse reasoning results in a substantial performance boost across datasets, even for very small models.

Existing dual-encoder methods in HTC achieve weak performance gains with huge memory overheads and their structure encoders heavily rely on domain knowledge. Under such observation, we tend to investigate the feasibility of a memory-friendly model with strong generalization capability that could boost the performance of HTC without prior statistics or label semantics. In this paper, we propose Hierarchy-aware Tree Isomorphism Network (HiTIN) to enhance the text representations with only syntactic information of the label hierarchy. Specifically, we convert the label hierarchy into an unweighted tree structure, termed coding tree, with the guidance of structural entropy.

Besides the text encoder, HiTIN only contains a few multi-layer perceptions and linear transformations, which greatly saves memory.

However, our research indicates that token-level alignment is also crucial in multilingual scenarios, which has not been fully explored previously. Based on our findings, we propose a dual-alignment pre-training (DAP) framework for cross-lingual sentence embedding that incorporates both sentence-level and token-level alignment. To achieve this, we introduce a novel representation translation learning (RTL) task, where the model learns to use one-side contextualized token representation to reconstruct its translation counterpart. This reconstruction objective encourages the model to embed translation information into the token representation. Compared to other token-level alignment methods such as translation language modeling, RTL is more suitable for dual encoder architectures and is computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on three sentence-level cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve sentence embedding.

Moreover, the limited amount of available training data leads to subpar performance in out-of-domain and cross-target scenarios, as data-driven approaches are prone to rely on superficial and domain-specific features.\nIn this work, we decompose the stance detection task from a linguistic perspective, and investigate key components and inference paths in this task. The stance triangle is a generic linguistic framework previously proposed to describe the fundamental ways people express their stance. We further expand it by characterizing the relationship between explicit and implicit objects. We then use the framework to extend one single training corpus with additional annotation.

Due to the task difficulty and data scarcity in the Financial NLP domain, we explore when aggregating such diverse skills from multiple datasets with MTL can work. Our findings suggest that the key to MTL success lies in skill diversity, relatedness between tasks, and choice of aggregation size and shared capacity.

In detail, the full and equivalent connections among utterances in regular Transformer ignore the sparse but distinctive dependency of an utterance on another in MPCs. To distinguish different relationships between utterances, four types of edges are designed to integrate graph-induced signals into attention mechanisms to refine PLMs originally designed for processing sequential texts. We evaluate GIFT by implementing it into three PLMs, and test the performance on three downstream tasks including addressee recognition, speaker identification and response selection. Experimental results show that GIFT can significantly improve the performance of three PLMs on three downstream tasks and two benchmarks with only 4 additional parameters per encoding layer, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on MPC understanding.","authors":["Jia-ChenGu","ZhenhuaLing","QuanLiu","CongLiu","GuopingHu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P1148","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76220/poster_document/e4722d2c2ac108b3fd832a332d4f4a9f.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76220/poster/b6c2bb1993d4852574834c4ca2b3ee90.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"GIFT: Graph-Induced Fine-Tuning for Multi-Party Conversation Understanding","tldr":"Addressing the issues of who saying what to whom in multi-party conversations (MPCs) has recently attracted a lot of research attention.

In this work, we propose a novel control framework using probability density estimation in the latent space.

Thus, we can perform sophisticated and flexible controls in the prior space and feed the control effects back into the latent space owing to the \nbijection property of invertible transformations. Experiments on single-attribute and multi-attribute control reveal that our method outperforms several strong baselines on attribute relevance and text quality, achieving a new SOTA.

To deal with the HTC problem, many existing works focus on utilizing the parent-child relationships that are explicitly shown in the hierarchy. However, texts with a category hierarchy also have some latent relevancy among labels in the same level of the hierarchy. We refer to these labels as peer labels, from which the peer effects are originally utilized in our work to improve the classification performance. To fully explore the peer-label relationship, we develop a PeerHTC method. This method innovatively measures the latent relevancy of peer labels through several metrics and then encodes the relevancy with a Graph Convolutional Neural Network. We also propose a sample importance learning method to ameliorate the side effects raised by modelling the peer label relevancy.

We evaluate all models on morphological and syntactic tasks, including lemmatization, which demonstrates the added value of T5's decoding abilities. We further define two probing tasks to investigate the knowledge acquired by models pre-trained on Classical texts. Our experiments provide the first benchmarking analysis of existing models of Ancient Greek. Results show that our models provide significant improvements over the SoTA. The systematic analysis of model types can inform future research in designing language models for Classical languages, including the development of novel generative tasks.

In-depth analysis suggests two main causes of these robustness deficits: distribution biases in the training datasets, and the tendency of the metric paradigm.

Several methods have been introduced to provide insight into the inference process of deep neural networks. However, most of these explainability methods have been shown to be brittle in the face of adversarial perturbations of their inputs in the image and generic textual domain. In this work we show that this phenomenon extends to specific and important high stakes domains like biomedical datasets. In particular, we observe that the robustness of explanations should be characterized in terms of the accuracy of the explanation in linking a model's inputs and its decisions - faithfulness - and its relevance from the perspective of domain experts - plausibility. This is crucial to prevent explanations that are inaccurate but still look convincing in the context of the domain at hand. To this end, we show how to adapt current attribution robustness estimation methods to a given domain, so as to take into account domain-specific plausibility. This results in our DomainAdaptiveAREstimator (DARE) attribution robustness estimator, allowing us to properly characterize the domain-specific robustness of faithful explanations. Next, we provide two methods, adversarial training and FAR training, to mitigate the brittleness characterized by DARE, allowing us to train networks that display robust attributions. Finally, we empirically validate our methods with extensive experiments on three established biomedical benchmarks.","authors":["AdamDanielIvankay","MattiaRigotti","PascalFrossard"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-nlp-applications-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P1265","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76223/poster_document/00e0062008b03454aae0c2f7c112ee96.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76223/poster/1adb2726f877c4495f18f3e1a245db88.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DARE: Towards Robust Text Explanations in Biomedical and Healthcare Applications","tldr":"Along with the successful deployment of deep neural networks in several application domains, the need to unravel the black-box nature of these networks has seen a significant increase recently.

To adopt prompt learning in the NER task, two kinds of methods have been explored from a pair of symmetric perspectives, populating the template by enumerating spans to predict their entity types or constructing type-specific prompts to locate entities. However, these methods not only require a multi-round prompting manner with a high time overhead and computational cost, but also require elaborate prompt templates, that are difficult to apply in practical scenarios. In this paper, we unify entity locating and entity typing into prompt learning, and design a dual-slot multi-prompt template with the position slot and type slot to prompt locating and typing respectively. Multiple prompts can be input to the model simultaneously, and then the model extracts all entities by parallel predictions on the slots. To assign labels for the slots during training, we design a dynamic template filling mechanism that uses the extended bipartite graph matching between prompts and the ground-truth entities. We conduct experiments in various settings, including resource-rich flat and nested NER datasets and low-resource in-domain and cross-domain datasets.

We propose to interpret the vector representations produced by dual encoders by projecting them into the model's vocabulary space. We show that the resulting projections contain rich semantic information, and draw connection between them and sparse retrieval. We find that this view can offer an explanation for some of the failure cases of dense retrievers. For example, we observe that the inability of models to handle tail entities is correlated with a tendency of the token distributions to forget some of the tokens of those entities.

Pretraining requires access to large volumes of unlabeled text. While monolingual text is readily available for many of the world's languages, access to large quantities of code-switched text (i.e., text with tokens of multiple languages interspersed within a sentence) is much more scarce. Given this resource constraint, the question of how pretraining using limited amounts of code-switched text could be altered to improve performance for code-switched NLP becomes important to tackle. In this paper, we explore different masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining techniques for code-switched text that are cognizant of language boundaries prior to masking. The language identity of the tokens can either come from human annotators, trained language classifiers, or simple relative frequency-based estimates. We also present an MLM variant by introducing a residual connection from an earlier layer in the pretrained model that uniformly boosts performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two downstream tasks, Question Answering (QA) and Sentiment Analysis (SA), involving four code-switched language pairs (Hindi-English, Spanish-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English) yield relative improvements of up to 5.8 and 2.7 F1 scores on QA (Hindi-English) and SA (Tamil-English), respectively, compared to standard pretraining techniques. To understand our task improvements better, we use a series of probes to study what additional information is encoded by our pretraining techniques and also introduce an auxiliary loss function that explicitly models language identification to further aid the residual MLM variants.","authors":["RicheekDas","SahasraRanjan","ShreyaPathak","PreethiJyothi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1315","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76568/poster_document/078e57b980e5eb6a48aca6dd588ba4be.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76568/poster/00a07aa1f155a88fe6206102279d5003.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP","tldr":"Pretrained models are a mainstay in modern NLP applications.

Thus instead of fine-tuning each BERT model in an ensemble (and running them all at test time), we need only fine-tune our single Multi-CLS BERT model (and run the one model at test time, ensembling just the multiple final CLS embeddings). To test its effectiveness, we build Multi-CLS BERT on top of a state-of-the-art pretraining method for BERT (Aroca-Ouellette and Rudzicz, 2020). In experiments on GLUE and SuperGLUE we show that our Multi-CLS BERT reliably improves both overall accuracy and confidence estimation. When only 100 training samples are available in GLUE, the Multi-CLS BERT\\_Base model can even outperform the corresponding BERT\\_Large model.

To extend the benefits of BLOOM to other languages without incurring prohibitively large costs, it is desirable to adapt BLOOM to new languages not seen during pretraining. In this work, we apply existing language adaptation strategies to BLOOM and benchmark its zero-shot prompting performance on eight new languages in a resource-constrained setting. We find language adaptation to be effective at improving zero-shot performance in new languages. Surprisingly, we find that adapter-based finetuning is more effective than continued pretraining for large models. In addition, we discover that prompting performance is not significantly affected by language specifics, such as the writing system. It is primarily determined by the size of the language adaptation data. We also add new languages to BLOOMZ, which is a multitask finetuned version of BLOOM capable of following task instructions zero-shot. We find including a new language in the multitask fine-tuning mixture to be the most effective method to teach BLOOMZ a new language. We conclude that with sufficient training data language adaptation can generalize well to diverse languages.

While temporal reasoning models can perform reasonably well on in-domain benchmarks, we have little idea of these systems' generalizability due to existing datasets' limitations. In this work, we introduce a novel task named TODAY that bridges this gap with temporal differential analysis, which as the name suggests, evaluates whether systems can correctly understand the effect of incremental changes. Specifically, TODAY introduces slight contextual changes for given event pairs, and systems are asked to tell how this subtle contextual change would affect relevant temporal relation distributions. To facilitate learning, TODAY also annotates human explanations. We show that existing models, including GPT-3.5, drop to random guessing on TODAY, suggesting that they heavily rely on spurious information rather than proper reasoning for temporal predictions. On the other hand, we show that TODAY's supervision style and explanation annotations can be used in joint learning, encouraging models to use more appropriate signals during training and thus outperform across several benchmarks.

To tackle this problem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder. Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation.

Recent literature has tackled low-resource RE by self-supervised learning, where the solution involves pretraining the entity pair embedding by RE-based objective and finetuning on labeled data by classification-based objective. However, a critical challenge to this approach is the gap in objectives, which prevents the RE model from fully utilizing the knowledge in pretrained representations. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap and propose to pretrain and finetune the RE model using consistent objectives of contrastive learning. Since in this kind of representation learning paradigm, one relation may easily form multiple clusters in the representation space, we further propose a multi-center contrastive loss that allows one relation to form multiple clusters to better align with pretraining. Experiments on two document-level RE datasets, BioRED and Re-DocRED, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Particularly, when using 1\\% end-task training data, our method outperforms PLM-based RE classifier by 10.5\\% and 6.1\\% on the two datasets, respectively.","authors":["WenxuanZhou","ShengZhang","TristanNaumann","MuhaoChen","HoifungPoon"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-information-extraction-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1476","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76592/poster_document/4970acdb9cfeaf50a64e472de543e965.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76592/poster/ba3314e07ce5ba8c768d1ab961207436.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Continual Contrastive Finetuning Improves Low-Resource Relation Extraction","tldr":"Relation extraction (RE), which has relied on structurally annotated corpora for model training, has been particularly challenging in low-resource scenarios and domains.

Motivated by the fact that humans can recognize the timbre of the same low-level concepts (e.g., footstep, rainfall, and laughing), even in different visual conditions, we aim to mitigate the domain discrepancies by audio-visual correlation.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation framework, named TAVT, which consists of two key components: Audio-Visual Meta-Mapper (AVMM) and Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCCL). (1) AVMM first introduces a universal auditory semantic space and drifts the domain-invariant low-level concepts into visual prefixes. Then the reconstruct-based learning encourages the AVMM to learn ``which pixels belong to the same sound'' and achieve audio-enhanced visual prefix. The well-trained AVMM can be further applied to uni-modal setting.

We develop a traffine attention mechanism to integrate heterogeneous factors including tasks, labels and inside tokens, and obtain the extraction target via a scoring matrix. Experiment results show that UniEX can outperform generative universal IE models in terms of performance and inference-speed on $14$ benchmarks IE datasets with the supervised setting. The state-of-the-art performance in low-resource scenarios also verifies the transferability and effectiveness of UniEX.","authors":["YangPing","JunYuLu","RuyiGan","JunjieWang","YuxiangZhang","PingjianZhang","JiaxingZhang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-information-extraction-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1541","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76601/poster_document/bf24ef18239b85555471b045a64157d7.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76601/poster/5b353a99d834ce9f238212b38a0aaf66.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"UniEX: An Effective and Efficient Framework for Unified Information Extraction via a Span-extractive Perspective","tldr":"We propose a new paradigm for universal information extraction (IE) that is compatible with any schema format and applicable to a list of IE tasks, such as named entity recognition, relation extractio...","track":"Information Extraction","underline_id":76601,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76601-uniex-an-effective-and-efficient-framework-for-unified-information-extraction-via-a-span-extractive-perspective","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52514/file/fd8b9050041ea1cbcb797ca3b3cccbac.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085046Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=51315970968e05b77d14ced738d9c974680b5b7814763334cc1c1970f46c1ebf"},{"abstract":"In cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER), self-training is commonly used to bridge the linguistic gap by training on pseudo-labeled target-language data.

The commonly utilized Hungarian algorithm for this procedure is restricted to handling one-to-one assignment among the desired tuples and tuple proposals, which ignores the correlation between proposals and affects the recall of the models. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic many-to-one label assignment strategy named IOT. Concretely, the label assignment process in OIE is formulated as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem. We leverage the intersection-over-union (IoU) as the assignment quality measurement, and convert the problem of finding the best assignment solution to the one of solving the optimal transport plan by maximizing the IoU values. To further utilize the knowledge from the assignment, we design an Assignment-guided Multi-granularity loss (AM) by simultaneously considering word-level and tuple-level information.

Pre-training is commonly regarded as an effective approach for multi-modal dialogue.

Yet another intriguing challenge emerges from the encompassing nature of multi-modal dialogue, which involves various modalities and tasks. Moreover, new forms of tasks may arise at unpredictable points in the future. Hence, it is essential for designed multi-modal dialogue models to possess sufficient flexibility to adapt to such scenarios. This paper proposes PaCE, a unified, structured, compositional multi-modal dialogue pre-training framework. It utilizes a combination of several fundamental experts to accommodate multiple dialogue-related tasks and can be pre-trained using limited dialogue and extensive non-dialogue multi-modal data.

In particular, we design the path aggregator and the relation-enhanced self-attention mechanism that complement each other.

Most previous debiasing techniques used Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) to balance the training corpus. However, CDA slightly modifies the original corpus, limiting the representation distance between different demographic groups to a narrow range. As a result, the debiasing model easily fits the differences between counterfactual pairs, which affects its debiasing performance with limited text resources. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training-inspired two-stage debiasing model using Contrastive learning with Continuous Prompt Augmentation (named CCPA) to mitigate social biases in PLMs' encoding. In the first stage, we propose a data augmentation method based on continuous prompt tuning to push farther the representation distance between sample pairs along different demographic groups. In the second stage, we utilize contrastive learning to pull closer the representation distance between the augmented sample pairs and then fine-tune PLMs' parameters to get debiased encoding. Our approach guides the model to achieve stronger debiasing performance by adding difficulty to the training process. Extensive experiments show that CCPA outperforms baselines in terms of debiasing performance.

Prior works on pretraining language models to improve the logical reasoning ability require complex processing of training data (e.g., aligning symbolic knowledge to text), yielding task-specific data augmentation that is not easy to adapt to any general text corpus. In this work, we propose APOLLO, a simple adaptive pretraining approach to improve the logical reasoning skills of language models. We select a subset of Wikipedia for adaptive pretraining using a set of logical inference keywords as filter words. Further, we propose two self-supervised loss functions for training. First, we modify the masked language modeling loss only to mask specific parts-of-speech words that likely require higher-order reasoning to predict them. Second, we propose a sentence-level classification loss that teaches the model to distinguish between entailment and contradiction types of sentences. The proposed pretraining paradigm is both simple and independent of task formats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of APOLLO by comparing it with prior baselines on two logical reasoning datasets. APOLLO performs comparably on ReClor and outperforms baselines on LogiQA.","authors":["SoumyaSanyal","YichongXu","ShuohangWang","ZiyiYang","ReidPryzant","WenhaoYu","ChenguangZhu","XiangRen"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1695","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76620/poster_document/abb8faa471db00e7abcc6517c9aca2c2.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76620/poster/73bbd4146c6cab36f05ffa8e58666270.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"APOLLO: A Simple Approach for Adaptive Pretraining of Language Models for Logical Reasoning","tldr":"Logical reasoning over text is an important ability that requires understanding the semantics of the text and reasoning through them to arrive at correct inferences.

In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised AES approach ULRA, which does not require groundtruth scores of essays for training. The core idea of our ULRA is to use multiple heuristic quality signals as the pseudo-groundtruth, and then train a neural AES model by learning from the aggregation of these quality signals. To aggregate these inconsistent quality signals into a unified supervision, we view the AES task as a ranking problem, and design a special Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation (DPRA) loss for training. In the DPRA loss, we set a learnable confidence weight for each signal to address the conflicts among signals, and train the neural AES model in a pairwise way to disentangle the cascade effect among partial-order pairs.

We are able to generate both abstractive summaries by decoding these frequent encodings, and extractive summaries by selecting the sentences assigned to the same frequent encodings. Our method is attributable, because the model identifies sentences used to generate the summary as part of the summarization process. It scales easily to many hundreds of input reviews, because aggregation is performed in the latent space rather than over long sequences of tokens. We also demonstrate that our appraoch enables a degree of control, generating aspect-specific summaries by restricting the model to parts of the encoding space that correspond to desired aspects (e.g., location or food).

In general, both tasks improve the ability of language understanding and generation by selectively using the denoising data.

In practice, Shapley Values are often estimated with a small number of stochastic model evaluations.

This can only be mitigated by aggregating thousands of model evaluations, which on the other hand, induces substantial computational overheads. To mitigate the trade-off between stability and efficiency, we develop an amortized model that directly predicts each input feature's Shapley Value without additional model evaluations. It is trained on a set of examples whose Shapley Values are estimated from a large number of model evaluations to ensure stability. Experimental results on two text classification datasets demonstrate that our amortized model estimates Shapley Values accurately with up to 60 times speedup compared to traditional methods.

Nonetheless, various PEFT methods are limited by their inherent characteristics. In the case of sparse fine-tuning, which involves modifying only a small subset of the existing parameters, the selection of fine-tuned parameters is task- and domain-specific, making it unsuitable for federated learning. On the other hand, PEFT methods with adding new parameters typically introduce additional inference latency. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating a sparse mask in a task-agnostic manner, wherein all downstream tasks share a common mask. Our approach, which relies solely on the magnitude information of pre-trained parameters, surpasses existing methodologies by a significant margin when evaluated on the GLUE benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a novel adapter technique that directly applies the adapter to pre-trained parameters instead of the hidden representation, thereby achieving identical inference speed to that of full fine-tuning.

However, these methods may suffer from label noise due to the automatic labeling process. In this paper, we propose CoLaDa, a Collaborative Label Denoising Framework, to address this problem. Specifically, we first explore a model-collaboration-based denoising scheme that enables models trained on different data sources to collaboratively denoise pseudo labels used by each other. We then present an instance-collaboration-based strategy that considers the label consistency of each token's neighborhood in the representation space for denoising. Experiments on different benchmark datasets show that the proposed CoLaDa achieves superior results compared to previous methods, especially when generalizing to distant languages.","authors":["TingtingMa","QianhuiWu","HuiqiangJiang","B\u00f6rjeF.Karlsson","TiejunZhao","Chin-YewLin"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1855","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76643/poster_document/dd7897fa75b6709eff4f1e5f2caef647.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76643/poster/c4ed8aa43d9274d2e7b9e6e8dfd827c5.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"CoLaDa: A Collaborative Label Denoising Framework for Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition","tldr":"Cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) aims to train an NER system that generalizes well to a target language by leveraging labeled data in a given source language.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.","authors":["YangLuo","XiaozheRen","ZangweiZheng","ZhuoJiang","XinJiang","YangYou"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1856","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76644/poster_document/e90f82e909e52d8d1924f3657fcc22b3.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76644/poster/a38d32c50aab9ffdcae26a9cabba83c2.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization","tldr":"Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models.

In this paper, we address two interrelated questions; (1) can we exploit task interdependence to improve prediction accuracy? and (2) can we predict new nodes with their attributes? We propose a unified framework that predicts node attributes and topology changes such as the appearance and disappearance of links and the emergence and loss of nodes. This frame-work comprises components for independent and interactive prediction and for predicting new nodes.

We evaluate 16 metrics and show that, pre-trained metrics like COMET have the highest correlations with annotator scores as opposed to n-gram metrics like BLEU. We further leverage our MQM annotations to develop an Indic-COMET metric and show that it outperforms COMET counterparts in both human scores correlations and robustness scores in Indian languages. Additionally, we show that the Indic-COMET can outperform COMET on some unseen Indian languages. We hope that our dataset and analysis will facilitate further research in Indic MT evaluation.","authors":["AnanyaSai B","TanayDixit","VigneshNagarajan","AnoopKunchukuttan","PratyushKumar","MiteshM.Khapra","RajDabre"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-resources-and-evaluation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1879","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76647/poster_document/a1806663cf9335d237935bcf49adef6e.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76647/poster/03c3bfecdf8adad4b1edae4250c8e482.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"IndicMT Eval: A Dataset to Meta-Evaluate Machine Translation Metrics for Indian Languages","tldr":"The rapid growth of machine translation (MT) systems necessitates meta-evaluations of evaluation metrics to enable selection of those that best reflect MT quality.

To further promote research in PCR, in this paper, we propose a new large benchmark (in English) for the PCR task: IL-PCR (Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval) corpus. Given the complex nature of case relevance and the long size of legal documents, BM25 remains a strong baseline for ranking the cited prior documents. In this work, we explore the role of events in legal case retrieval and propose an unsupervised retrieval method-based pipeline U-CREAT (Unsupervised Case Retrieval using Events Extraction). We find that the proposed unsupervised retrieval method significantly increases performance compared to BM25 and makes retrieval faster by a considerable margin, making it applicable to real-time case retrieval systems. Our proposed system is generic, we show that it generalizes across two different legal systems (Indian and Canadian), and it shows state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks for both the legal systems (IL-PCR and COLIEE corpora).","authors":["AbhinavJoshi","AkshatSharma","Sai KiranTanikella","AshutoshModi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1917","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76652/poster_document/93036251207c9faeec6a6584064cb00c.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76652/poster/08c19d7157dabbf803ef14e9193a8f2c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"U-CREAT: Unsupervised Case Retrieval using Events extrAcTion","tldr":"The task of Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) in the legal domain is about automatically citing relevant (based on facts and precedence) prior legal cases in a given query case.

However, the ability of in-context learning is not fully exploited because language models are not explicitly trained to learn in context. To this end, we propose PICL (Pre-training for In-Context Learning), a framework to enhance the language models' in-context learning ability by pre-training the model on a large collection of \"intrinsic tasks\" in the general plain-text corpus using the simple language modeling objective. PICL encourages the model to infer and perform tasks by conditioning on the contexts while maintaining task generalization of pre-trained models. We evaluate the in-context learning performance of the model trained with PICL on seven widely-used text classification datasets and the Super-NaturalInstrctions benchmark, which contains 100+ NLP tasks formulated to text generation. Our experiments show that PICL is more effective and task-generalizable than a range of baselines, outperforming larger language models with nearly 4x parameters.

This includes two approaches: a row-wise generator and an LLM prompting generator~(first time used in this task).

Firstly, KB-BINDER leverages large language models like Codex to generate logical forms as the draft for a specific question by imitating a few demonstrations.

The classical automated reasoning literature has shown that reasoning in the backward direction (i.e. from intended conclusion to supporting axioms) is significantly more efficient at proof-finding. Importing this intuition into the LM setting, we develop a Backward Chaining algorithm, called LAMBADA, that decomposes reasoning into four sub-modules, that are simply implemented by few-shot prompted LLM inference.

Given the vast array of available models, it is of both theoretical and methodological importance to assess what features of a model influence its psychometric quality. In this work we focus on parameter size, showing that larger Transformer-based language models generate probabilistic estimates that are less predictive of early eye-tracking measurements reflecting lexical access and early semantic integration. However, relatively bigger models show an advantage in capturing late eye-tracking measurements that reflect the full semantic and syntactic integration of a word into the current language context. Our results are supported by eye movement data in ten languages and consider four models, spanning from 564M to 4.5B parameters.","authors":["AndreaGregorde Varda","MarcoMarelli"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-linguistic-theories,-cognitive-modeling,-and-psycholinguistics-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2018","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76659/poster_document/e70e1aba91bfa4d455aa981c41524fd5.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76659/poster/fe2e406b68499ef1f086f166cc20c77a.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Scaling in Cognitive Modelling: a Multilingual Approach to Human Reading Times","tldr":"Neural language models are increasingly valued in computational psycholinguistics, due to their ability to provide conditional probability distributions over the lexicon that are predictive of human p...","track":"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics","underline_id":76659,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76659-scaling-in-cognitive-modelling-a-multilingual-approach-to-human-reading-times","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52692/file/a9d50dda739f851702bddb76e60d8dfb.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085046Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4d79d69e433cc9daf8a683f0c689befba6db9cf1a7e3c8defd1a672d3192ace3"},{"abstract":"Despite the rising prevalence of neural sequence models, recent empirical evidences suggest their deficiency in compositional generalization. One of the current de-facto solutions to this problem is compositional data augmentation, aiming to incur additional compositional inductive bias. Nonetheless, the improvement offered by existing handcrafted augmentation strategies is limited when successful systematic generalization of neural sequence models requires multi-grained compositional bias (i.e., not limited to either lexical or structural biases only) or differentiation of training sequences in an imbalanced difficulty distribution. To address the two challenges, we first propose a novel compositional augmentation strategy dubbed Span Substitution (SpanSub) that enables multi-grained composition of substantial substructures in the whole training set. Over and above that, we introduce the Learning to Substitute Span (L2S2) framework which empowers the learning of span substitution probabilities in SpanSub in an end-to-end manner by maximizing the loss of neural sequence models, so as to outweigh those challenging compositions with elusive concepts and novel surroundings. Our empirical results on three standard compositional generalization benchmarks, including SCAN, COGS and GeoQuery (with an improvement of at most 66.5\\%, 10.3\\%, 1.2\\%, respectively), demonstrate the superiority of SpanSub, L2S2 and their combination.","authors":["ZhaoyiLi","YingWei","DefuLian"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-semantics_-lexical-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P2023","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76235/poster_document/1ae83b970ccfa5f5691981790c509f2f.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76235/poster/4d9fd8a1c5d6eef310115e022d4f0cf1.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Learning to Substitute Spans towards Improving Compositional Generalization","tldr":"Despite the rising prevalence of neural sequence models, recent empirical evidences suggest their deficiency in compositional generalization.

In this paper, we operationalize appropriate language in argumentation for the first time. In particular, we model appropriateness through the absence of flaws, grounded in research on argument quality assessment, especially in aspects from rhetoric. From these, we derive a new taxonomy of 14 dimensions that determine inappropriate language in online discussions. Building on three  argument quality corpora, we then create a corpus of 2191 arguments annotated for the 14 dimensions. Empirical analyses support that the taxonomy covers the concept of appropriateness comprehensively, showing several plausible correlations with argument quality dimensions. Moreover, results of baseline approaches to assessing appropriateness suggest that all dimensions can be modeled computationally on the corpus.","authors":["TimonZiegenbein","ShahbazSyed","FelixLange","MartinPotthast","HenningWachsmuth"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P203","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76380/poster_document/20c12e58948ecccee6d2960c5f3fbf3a.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Modeling Appropriate Language in Argumentation","tldr":"Online discussion moderators must make ad-hoc decisions about whether the contributions of discussion participants are appropriate or should be removed to maintain civility.

In this paper, we analyze and identify the psycholinguistic bias in the text and the bias of inferring news label based on only image features. We mitigate these biases from a causality perspective and propose a Causal intervention and Counterfactual reasoning based Debiasing framework (CCD) for multi-modal fake news detection. To achieve our goal, we first utilize causal intervention to remove the psycholinguistic bias which introduces the spurious correlations between text features and news label. And then, we apply counterfactual reasoning by imagining a counterfactual world where each news has only image features for estimating the direct effect of the image. Therefore we can eliminate the image-only bias by deducting the direct effect of the image from the total effect on labels.

We notice that human reasoning has a dual reasoning framework that consists of an immediate reaction system (system 1) and a delicate reasoning system (system 2), where the entire reasoning is determined by their interaction. This inspires us to develop a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the verifier. In our approach, the generator is responsible for generating reasoning paths, and the verifiers are used to supervise the evaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator.

First, we observe that for models with the same architecture and size, individual Multi-Model classifiers outperform their Early-Exit counterparts by an average of 2.3\\%. We show that this gap is caused by Early-Exit classifiers sharing model parameters during training, resulting in conflicting gradient updates of model weights. We find that despite this gap, Early-Exit still provides a better speed-accuracy trade-off due to the overhead of the Multi-Model approach. To address these issues, we propose SWEET (Separating Weights for Early-Exit Transformers) an Early-Exit fine-tuning method that assigns each classifier its own set of unique model weights, not updated by other classifiers. We compare SWEET's speed-accuracy curve to standard Early-Exit and Multi-Model baselines and find that it outperforms both methods at fast speeds while maintaining comparable scores to Early- Exit at slow speeds.

Unfortunately, transcripts are only sometimes available since numerous unwritten languages exist worldwide. In this paper, we aim to utilize large amounts of target-side monolingual data to enhance ST without transcripts. Motivated by the remarkable success of back translation in MT, we develop a back translation algorithm for ST (BT4ST) to synthesize pseudo ST data from monolingual target data.

A common way to address this problem is to use distantly annotated training data that contains incorrect labels. However, the performance of models trained solely with such data can be limited by the errors in the automatic annotation. Recently, there are a few approaches that no longer follow this conventional way. But without using sufficient direct entity typing supervision may also cause them to yield inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can avoid the need of creating distantly labeled data whenever there is a new type schema. We first train an entity typing model that have an extremely board type coverage by using the ultra-fine entity typing data. Then, when there is a need to produce a model for a newly designed fine-grained entity type schema. We can simply fine-tune the previously trained model with a small number of examples annotated under this schema. Experimental results show that our approach achieves outstanding performance for FET under the few-shot setting.

Yet, standard decoding methods (i.e., beam search, nucleus sampling, and diverse beam search) produce candidates with redundant, and often low quality, content. In this paper, we design a novel method to generate candidates for re-ranking that addresses these issues.  We ground each candidate abstract on its own unique content plan and generate distinct plan-guided abstracts using a model's top beam. More concretely, a standard language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit (EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top K beams from the content plan generator are then used to guide a separate LM, which produces a single abstractive candidate for each distinct plan. We apply an existing re-ranker (BRIO) to abstractive candidates generated from our method, as well as baseline decoding methods. We show large relevance improvements over previously published methods on widely used single document news article corpora, with ROUGE-2 F1 gains of 0.88, 2.01, and 0.38 on CNN / Dailymail, NYT, and Xsum, respectively. A human evaluation on CNN / DM validates these results. Similarly, on 1k samples from CNN / DM, we show that prompting GPT-3 to follow EDU plans outperforms sampling-based methods by by 1.05 ROUGE-2 F1 points.

These details can be important for low-resourced languages that need to plan the production of datasets. We evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically the differences of five different languages with different pretraining dataset sizes and three different tokenization methods for each. The results confirm that the size of the vocabulary due to morphological characteristics is directly correlated with both the LM perplexity and the performance of two typical downstream tasks such as NER identification and POS labeling.

To eliminate the manual efforts, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with ``\\textit{Let's think step by step}'' as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors,  missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors.

To address the calculation errors and improve the quality of generated reasoning steps, we extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions and derive PS+ prompting. We evaluate our proposed prompting strategy on ten datasets across three reasoning problems.

To step over these obstacles, an effective way is to pre-train a model that understands the discourse structure of multi-party dialogues, namely, to whom each utterance is replying. However, due to the lack of explicitly annotated discourse labels in multi-party dialogue corpora, previous works fail to scale up the pre-training process by putting aside the unlabeled multi-party conversational data for nothing. To fully utilize the unlabeled data, we propose to treat the discourse structures as latent variables, then jointly infer them and pre-train the discourse-aware model by unsupervised latent variable inference methods. Experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our pre-trained model outperforms strong baselines by large margins and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, justifying the effectiveness of our method.

Specifically, in choosing between the probable next token predictions of a generative model, the predictions of lower layers can be used to highlight which candidates are best avoided. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the contrast between layers to improve text generation outputs, and show that it mitigates degenerative behaviors of the model in open-ended generation, significantly improving the quality of generated texts.

the last five years, there has been a significant focus in Natural Language Processing (NLP) on developing larger Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and introducing benchmarks such as SuperGLUE and

These PLMs have achieved impressive results on these benchmarks, even surpassing human performance in some cases. This has led to claims of superhuman capabilities and the provocative idea that certain tasks have been solved. In this position paper, we take a critical look at these claims and ask whether PLMs truly have superhuman abilities and what the current benchmarks are really evaluating.

To measure robustness, several existing approaches edit the text data, but without leveraging the cross-modal information present in multimodal data. Such information from the visual modality, such as color, size, and shape, provides additional attributes that users can include in their inputs. Thus, we propose cross-modal attribute insertions as a realistic perturbation strategy for vision-and-language data that inserts visual attributes of the objects in the image into the corresponding text (e.g., \"girl on a chair'' to \"little girl on a wooden chair''). Our proposed approach for cross-modal attribute insertions is modular, controllable, and task-agnostic. We find that augmenting input text using cross-modal insertions causes state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-image retrieval and cross-modal entailment to perform poorly, resulting in relative drops of ~15\\% in MRR and ~20\\% in F1 score, respectively. Crowd-sourced annotations demonstrate that cross-modal insertions lead to higher quality augmentations for multimodal data than augmentations using text-only data, and are equivalent in quality to original examples.

In this work we propose a {\\em conjunct resolution} task that operates directly on the text and makes use of a {\\em split-and-rephrase} paradigm in order to recover the missing elements in the coordination structure. To this end, we first formulate a pragmatic framework of verbal omissions which describes the different types of omissions, and develop an automatic scalable collection method. Based on this method, we curate a large dataset, containing over 10K examples of naturally-occurring verbal omissions with crowd-sourced annotations of the resolved conjuncts. We train various neural baselines for this task, and show that while our best method obtains decent performance, it leaves ample space for improvement.

Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets at various data scales demonstrate that UnitY outperforms a single-pass speech-to-unit translation model by 2.5-4.2 ASR-BLEU with 2.83x decoding speed-up. We show that the proposed methods boost the performance even when predicting spectrogram in the second pass. However, predicting discrete units achieves 2.51x decoding speed-up compared to that case.","authors":["HirofumiInaguma","SravyaPopuri","IliaKulikov","Peng-JenChen","ChanghanWang","Yu-AnChung","YunTang","AnnLee","ShinjiWatanabe","JuanPino"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-speech-and-multimodality-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2160","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"UnitY: Two-pass Direct Speech-to-speech Translation with Discrete Units","tldr":"Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components can be optimized jointly, is advantageous over cascaded approaches to achieve fast inference with a simplified pipeline.

While existing work primarily focused on the lexical specialization of monolingual PLMs with immense quantities of monolingual constraints, in this work we expose massively multilingual transformers (MMTs, e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) to multilingual lexical knowledge at scale, leveraging BabelNet as the readily available rich source of multilingual and cross-lingual type-level lexical knowledge. Concretely, we use BabelNet's multilingual synsets to create synonym pairs (or synonym-gloss pairs) across 50 languages and then subject the MMTs (mBERT and XLM-R) to a lexical specialization procedure guided by a contrastive objective. We show that such massively multilingual lexical specialization brings substantial gains in two standard cross-lingual lexical tasks, bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity, as well as in cross-lingual sentence retrieval. Crucially, we observe gains for languages unseen in specialization, indicating that multilingual lexical specialization enables generalization to languages with no lexical constraints. In a series of subsequent controlled experiments, we show that the number of specialization constraints plays a much greater role than the set of languages from which they originate.","authors":["TommasoGreen","Simone PaoloPonzetto","GoranGlava\u0161"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2166","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76688/poster_document/48efe282c7118e0f887b3da117bae117.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76688/poster/87adf4ad66a797a5b3fc304fe5106c8d.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Massively Multilingual Lexical Specialization of Multilingual Transformers","tldr":"While pretrained language models (PLMs) primarily serve as general-purpose text encoders that can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks, recent work has shown that they can also be rewi...","track":"Multilingualism and Cross-Lingual NLP","underline_id":76688,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76688-massively-multilingual-lexical-specialization-of-multilingual-transformers","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52771/file/70eb63a6d50bf7eabc13cc59d353f7ad.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085047Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=48b726995eb9d5742744d69206043366f563c02cec81d5f9b617975707565d9d"},{"abstract":"Language models (LMs) now excel at many tasks such as question answering, reasoning, and dialog.

Unfortunately, lexical matching fails completely when a plausible candidate answer does not appear in the list of gold answers, which is increasingly the case as we shift from extractive to generative models. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical matching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making matching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-open, a popular benchmark. Our assessments reveal that while the true performance of all models is significantly underestimated, the performance of the InstructGPT (zero-shot) LLM increases by nearly +60\\%, making it on par with existing top models, and the InstructGPT (few-shot) model actually achieves a new state-of-the-art on NQ-open. We also find that more than 50\\% of lexical matching failures are attributed to semantically equivalent answers. We further demonstrate that regex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still suffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human evaluation.","authors":["EhsanKamalloo","NouhaDziri","CharlesClarke","DavoodRafiei"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P2229","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76248/poster_document/8476279acd229615d4e3f2c0d1b52f92.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76248/poster/aa9e6553cd31069e1df2fdbaa25ab77c.png","program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models","tldr":"Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain question answering (QA).

In this paper, we consider a more feasible proxy task: Identify the distinct sets of aligned story actors responsible for sustaining the issue-specific narratives. Discovering aligned actors, and the groups these alignments create, brings us closer to estimating the narrative that each group represents. With the help of Large Language Models (LLM), we address this task by: (i) Introducing a corpus of text segments rich in narrative content associated with six different current  issues; (ii) Introducing a novel two-step graph-based framework that (a) identifies alignments between actors (INCANT) and (b) extracts aligned actor groups using the network structure (TAMPA). Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new task Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) that aims to extract the (target, stance) pair from the text. We benchmark the task by proposing a two-stage framework that first identifies the relevant target in the text and then detects the stance given the predicted target and text. Specifically, we first propose two different settings: Target Classification and Target Generation, to identify the potential target from a given text. Then we propose a multi-task approach that takes target prediction as the auxiliary task to detect the stance toward the predicted target. We evaluate the proposed framework on both in-target stance detection in which the test target is always seen in the training stage and zero-shot stance detection that needs to detect the stance for the targets that are unseen during the training phase.

However, existing studies usually predict sentiment elements in a fixed order, which ignores the effect of the interdependence of the elements in a sentiment tuple and the diversity of language expression on the results. In this work, we propose Multi-view Prompting (MVP) that aggregates sentiment elements generated in different orders, leveraging the intuition of human-like problem-solving processes from different views. Specifically, MVP introduces element order prompts to guide the language model to generate multiple sentiment tuples, each with a different element order, and then selects the most reasonable tuples by voting. MVP can naturally model multi-view and multi-task as permutations and combinations of elements, respectively, outperforming previous task-specific designed methods on multiple ABSA tasks with a single model. Extensive experiments show that MVP significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on 10 datasets of 4 benchmark tasks, and performs quite effectively in low-resource settings. Detailed evaluation verified the effectiveness, flexibility, and cross-task transferability of MVP.","authors":["ZhibinGou","QingyanGuo","YujiuYang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P228","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76383/poster_document/24cc883e0a5d1545e12fcf96511727eb.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"MvP: Multi-view Prompting Improves Aspect Sentiment Tuple Prediction","tldr":"Generative methods greatly promote aspect-based sentiment analysis via generating a sequence of sentiment elements in a specified format.

Multi-VALUE maps SAE to synthetic forms of each dialect. First, we use this system to stress tests question answering, machine translation, and semantic parsing. Stress tests reveal significant performance disparities for leading models on non-standard dialects. Second, we use this system as a data augmentation technique to improve the dialect robustness of existing systems.

However, collecting and labeling large-scale datasets is time-consuming and expensive for many scenarios and languages. Therefore, sufficient labeled pairs are usually not available. To deal with the label shortage problem, we present a simple yet effective zero-shot approach MultiCapCLIP that can generate visual captions for different scenarios and languages without any labeled vision-caption pairs of downstream datasets. In the training stage, MultiCapCLIP only requires text data for input. Then it conducts two main steps: 1) retrieving concept prompts that preserve the corresponding domain knowledge of new scenarios; 2) auto-encoding the prompts to learn writing styles to output captions in a desired language. In the testing stage, MultiCapCLIP instead takes visual data as input directly to retrieve the concept prompts to generate the final visual descriptions. The extensive experiments on image and video captioning across four benchmarks and four languages (i.e., English, Chinese, German, and French) confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Though such systems have achieved impressive results across a variety of datasets and domains, recent works have called into question whether they are ultimately limited in their ability to compositionally generalize. In this work, we approach semantic parsing from, quite literally, the opposite direction; that is, we introduce a neural semantic parsing generation method that constructs logical forms from the bottom up, beginning from the logical form's leaves. The system we introduce is lazy in that it incrementally builds up a set of potential semantic parses, but only expands and processes the most promising candidate parses at each generation step. Such a parsimonious expansion scheme allows the system to maintain an arbitrarily large set of parse hypotheses that are never realized and thus incur minimal computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on compositional generalization; specifically, on the challenging CFQ dataset and two other Text-to-SQL datasets where we show that our novel, bottom-up semantic parsing technique outperforms general-purpose semantic parsers while also being competitive with semantic parsers that have been tailored to each task.","authors":["MaxwellCrouse","PavanKapanipathi","SubhajitChaudhury","TahiraNaseem","RamonFernandez Astudillo","AchilleFokoue","TimKlinger"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-question-answering-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2364","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76713/poster_document/92b2228be0023883c3e6a6f8c7ccd169.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Laziness Is a Virtue When It Comes to Compositionality in Neural Semantic Parsing","tldr":"Nearly all general-purpose neural semantic parsers generate logical forms in a strictly top-down autoregressive fashion.

For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations.

To address this problem, unsupervised selective rationalization produces rationales alongside predictions by chaining two jointly-trained components, a rationale generator and a predictor. Although this architecture guarantees that the prediction relies solely on the rationale, it does not ensure that the rationale contains a plausible explanation for the prediction.

We show how word preferences in a large language model reflect social attitudes about gender, using two datasets from human experiments that found differences in  gendered or gender neutral word choices by participants with differing views on gender (progressive, moderate, or conservative). We find that the language model BERT takes into account factors that shape human lexical choice of such language, but may not weigh those factors in the same way people do. Moreover, we show that BERT's predictions most resemble responses from participants with moderate to conservative views on gender.

Recent empirical work and theoretical analysis with over-parameterized neural networks challenges the classic bias-variance trade-off notion suggesting that no such trade-off holds: as the width of the network grows, bias monotonically decreases while variance initially increases followed by a decrease. In this work, we first provide a variance decomposition-based justification criteria to examine whether large pretrained neural models in a fine-tuning setting are generalizable enough to have low bias and variance. We then perform theoretical and empirical analysis using ensemble methods explicitly designed to decrease variance due to optimization. This results in essentially a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm that first ratchets down bias and variance iteratively, and then uses a selected fixed-bias model to further reduce variance due to optimization by ensembling. We also analyze the nature of variance change with the ensemble size in low- and high-resource classes.

However, we argue that these methods fail to take advantage of the benefits of the data transfer approach where a cross-lingual model is trained on target-language data and is able to learn task-specific information from syntactical features or word-label relations in the target language. As such, we propose a hybrid knowledge-transfer approach that leverages a teacher-student framework where the teacher and student networks are trained following the direct and data transfer approaches, respectively. Our method is complemented by a hierarchical training-sample selection scheme designed to address the issue of noisy labels being generated by the teacher model.

KG has abundant global and local structural information, however, many GNN-based KGC models cannot capture these two types of information about the graph structure by designing complex aggregation schemes, and are not designed well to learn representations of seen entities with sparse neighborhoods in isolated subgraphs. In this paper, we find that a simple attention-based method can outperform a general GNN-based approach for KGC. We then propose a double-branch multi-attention based graph neural network (MA-GNN) to learn more expressive entity representations which contain rich global-local structural information. Specifically, we first explore the graph attention network-based local aggregator to learn entity representations.

We introduce a set of tests from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from five pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge---however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.","authors":["JiaxuanLi","LangYu","AllysonEttinger"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2511","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Counterfactual reasoning: Testing language models' understanding of hypothetical scenarios","tldr":"Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical re...","track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","underline_id":76732,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76732-counterfactual-reasoning-testing-language-models-understanding-of-hypothetical-scenarios","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Conditional inference on joint textual and visual clues is a multi-modal reasoning task that textual clues provide prior permutation or external knowledge, which are complementary with visual content and pivotal to deducing the correct option.

To address this issue, we propose a Multi-modal Context  Reasoning approach, named ModCR. Compared to VLMs performing reasoning via cross modal semantic alignment, it regards the given textual abstract semantic and objective image information as the pre-context information and embeds them into the language model to perform context reasoning. Different from recent vision-aided language models used in natural language processing, ModCR incorporates the multi-view semantic alignment information between language and vision by introducing the learnable alignment prefix between image and text in the pretrained language model. This makes the language model well-suitable for such multi-modal reasoning scenario on joint textual and visual clues.

Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.","authors":["VijayViswanathan","LuyuGao","TongshuangWu","PengfeiLiu","GrahamNeubig"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2530","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76737/poster_document/27d7bed96eef6d11212f76dcd0c98317.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DataFinder: Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions","tldr":"Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas.

However, the encoding-task coupling requirement results in the repeated encoding of the same documents for different tasks and queries, which is highly computationally inefficient. To this end, we target to decouple document encoding from downstream tasks, and propose to represent each document as a plug-and-play document module, i.e., a document plugin, for PTMs (PlugD). By inserting document plugins into the backbone PTM for downstream tasks, we can encode a document one time to handle multiple tasks, which is more efficient than conventional encoding-task coupling methods that simultaneously encode documents and input queries using task-specific encoders. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets of 4 typical NLP tasks show that PlugD enables models to encode documents once and for all across different scenarios. Especially, PlugD can save 69\\% computational costs while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art encoding-task coupling methods. Additionally, we show that PlugD can serve as an effective post-processing way to inject knowledge into task-specific models, improving model performance without any additional model training.

We present SymbolicToM, a plug-and-play approach to reason about the belief states of multiple characters in reading comprehension tasks via explicit symbolic representation. More concretely, our approach tracks each entity's beliefs, their estimation of other entities' beliefs, and higher-order levels of reasoning, all through graphical representations, allowing for more precise and interpretable reasoning than previous approaches. Empirical results on the well-known ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019) demonstrate that SymbolicToM dramatically enhances off-the-shelf neural networks' theory of mind in a zero-shot setting while showing robust out-of-distribution performance compared to supervised baselines.

In order to learn well-separated representations for utterances with multiple intents, we first introduce a label-semantic augmentation module incorporating class name information. For better consideration of the inherent intra-class and inter-class relations, an instance-level and a class-level graph neural network are constructed, which not only propagate label information but also propagate feature structure.

By learning structural constraints for each training triple, these methods implicitly memorize intrinsic relation rules to infer missing links. However, this paper points out that the multi-hop relation rules are hard to be reliably memorized due to the inherent deficiencies of such implicit memorization strategy, making embedding models underperform in predicting links between distant entity pairs. To alleviate this problem, we present Vertical Learning Paradigm (VLP), which extends embedding models by allowing to explicitly copy target information from related factual triples for more accurate prediction. Rather than solely relying on the implicit memory, VLP directly provides additional cues to improve the generalization ability of embedding models, especially making the distant link prediction significantly easier.

Despite its simplicity and superior performance demonstrated, a decline in disease diagnosis accuracy is observed caused by 1) a mismatch between symptoms observed during training and generation, and 2) the effect of different symptom orders on disease prediction. To address the above obstacles, we introduce the CoAD, a novel disease and symptom collaborative generation framework, which incorporates several key innovations to improve AD: 1) aligning sentence-level disease labels with multiple possible symptom inquiry steps to bridge the gap between training and generation; 2) expanding symptom labels for each sub-sequence of symptoms to enhance annotation and eliminate the effect of symptom order; 3) developing a repeated symptom input schema to effectively and efficiently learn the expanded disease and symptom labels.

Compared with other data augmentation strategies, ACLM can generate more diverse and coherent augmentations preserving the true word sense of complex entities in the sentence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLM both qualitatively and quantitatively on monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual complex NER across various low-resource settings. ACLM outperforms all our neural baselines by a significant margin (1\\%-36\\%). In addition, we demonstrate the application of ACLM to other domains that suffer from data scarcity (e.g., biomedical).

A common practice is to recast the task into a text-to-text format such that generative LLMs of natural language (NL-LLMs) like GPT-3 can be prompted to solve it. However, it is nontrivial to perform information extraction (IE) tasks with NL-LLMs since the output of the IE task is usually structured and therefore is hard to be converted into plain text. In this paper, we propose to recast the structured output in the form of code instead of natural language and utilize generative LLMs of code (Code-LLMs) such as Codex to perform IE tasks, in particular, named entity recognition and relation extraction. In contrast to NL-LLMs, we show that Code-LLMs can be well-aligned with these IE tasks by designing code-style prompts and formulating these IE tasks as code generation tasks. Experiment results on seven benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms fine-tuning moderate-size pre-trained models specially designed for IE tasks (e.g., UIE) and prompting NL-LLMs under few-shot settings. We further conduct a series of in-depth analyses to demonstrate the merits of leveraging Code-LLMs for IE tasks.","authors":["PengLi","TianxiangSun","QiongTang","HangYan","YuanbinWu","XuanjingHuang","XipengQiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2649","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76752/poster_document/e838d26e6f5a394facf96e6b062eb959.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors","tldr":"Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on massive corpora have demonstrated impressive few-shot learning ability on many NLP tasks.

A moral dialogue system aligned with users' values could enhance conversation engagement and user connections. In this paper, we propose a framework, MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. In our framework, we first explore the communication mechanisms of morality and resolve expressed morality into three parts, which indicate the roadmap for building a moral dialogue system. Based on that, we design a simple yet effective method: constructing moral discussions between simulated specific users and the dialogue system. The constructed discussions consist of expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views in dialogue exchanges, which makes conversational models learn morality well in a natural manner.

The second is that often, one modality (e.g., text) is stronger and more relevant, making it difficult to identify meaningful patterns in the weaker modality (e.g., image). Our approach focuses on more effectively exploiting the weaker modality while dynamically regularizing the loss function. First, we introduce a new two-stream model called Multimodal BERT-ViT, which features a novel intra-CLS token fusion. Second, we utilize a dynamic adjustment that maintains a balance between specialization and generalization during the training to avoid overfitting, which we devised. We add this dynamic adjustment to the Unsupervised Data Augmentation (UDA) framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of these proposals on the task of multi-label movie genre classification using the Moviescope and MM-IMDb datasets.

In particular, we study generative models of commonsense knowledge, focusing on the task of generating generics, statements of commonsense facts about everyday concepts, e.g., birds can fly.\n\nWe introduce I2D2, a novel commonsense distillation framework that loosely follows the Symbolic Knowledge Distillation of West et al. but breaks the dependence on the extreme-scale teacher model with two innovations: (1) the novel adaptation of NeuroLogic Decoding to enhance the generation quality of the weak, off-the-shelf language models, and (2) self-imitation learning to iteratively learn from the model's own enhanced commonsense acquisition capabilities. Empirical results suggest that scale is not the only way, as novel algorithms can be a promising alternative.

However, existing dataset drift metrics in NLP have generally not considered specific dimensions of linguistic drift that affect model performance, and they have not been validated in their ability to predict model performance at the individual example level, where such metrics are often used in practice. In this paper, we propose three dimensions of linguistic dataset drift: vocabulary, structural, and semantic drift. These dimensions correspond to content word frequency divergences, syntactic divergences, and meaning changes not captured by word frequencies (e.g. lexical semantic change). We propose interpretable metrics for all three drift dimensions, and we modify past performance prediction methods to predict model performance at both the example and dataset level for English sentiment classification and natural language inference. We find that our drift metrics are more effective than previous metrics at predicting out-of-domain model accuracies (mean 16.8\\% root mean square error decrease), particularly when compared to popular fine-tuned embedding distances (mean 47.7\\% error decrease). Fine-tuned embedding distances are much more effective at ranking individual examples by expected performance, but decomposing into vocabulary, structural, and semantic drift produces the best example rankings of all considered model-agnostic drift metrics (mean 6.7\\% ROC AUC increase).","authors":["TylerA.Chang","KishaloyHalder","NehaAnna John","YogarshiVyas","YassineBenajiba","MiguelBallesteros","DanRoth"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2755","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76770/poster_document/9eb737dba26b53e09cd2825ee900a4b5.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Characterizing and Measuring Linguistic Dataset Drift","tldr":"NLP models often degrade in performance when real world data distributions differ markedly from training data.

However, it may suffer from the forgetting problem and the structural inconsistency between pretrained LMs and NMT models. Knowledge distillation (KD) may be a potential solution to alleviate these issues, but few studies have investigated language knowledge transfer from pretrained language models to NMT models through KD. In this paper, we propose Pretrained Bidirectional Distillation (PBD) for NMT, which aims to efficiently transfer bidirectional language knowledge from masked language pretraining to NMT models. Its advantages are reflected in efficiency and effectiveness through a globally defined and bidirectional context-aware distillation objective. Bidirectional language knowledge of the entire sequence is transferred to an NMT model concurrently during translation training. Specifically, we propose self-distilled masked language pretraining to obtain the PBD objective. We also design PBD losses to efficiently distill the language knowledge, in the form of token probabilities, to the encoder and decoder of an NMT model using the PBD objective. Extensive experiments reveal that pretrained bidirectional distillation can significantly improve machine translation performance and achieve competitive or even better results than previous pretrain-finetune or unified multilingual translation methods in supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot scenarios. Empirically, it is concluded that pretrained bidirectional distillation is an effective and efficient method for transferring language knowledge from pretrained language models to NMT models.","authors":["YimengZhuang","MeiTu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P276","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76393/poster_document/670d874edb56a40b6024df1055369eff.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Pretrained Bidirectional Distillation for Machine Translation","tldr":"Knowledge transfer can boost neural machine translation (NMT), for example, by finetuning a pretrained masked language model (LM).

Specifically, given knowledge data, we first heuristically determine a dialogue flow, which is a series of knowledge pieces. Then, we employ T5 to incrementally turn the dialogue flow into a dialogue. To ensure coherence of both the dialogue flow and the synthetic dialogue, we design a two-level filtering strategy, at the flow-level and the utterance-level respectively.

Recent studies try to reduce the information gap between decision-making and question generation, in order to improve the performance of generation. However, the information gap still persists because these methods are still limited in pipeline framework, where decision-making and question generation are performed separately, making it hard to share the entailment reasoning used in decision-making across all stages. To tackle the above problem, we propose a novel one-stage end-to-end framework, called Entailment Fused-T5 (EFT), to bridge the information gap between decision-making and question generation in a global understanding manner.

According to this principle, we construct a dataset, and devise a multi-modal transformer model.

The model consists of uni-modal transformer modules that learn representations for each modality, and a multi-modal transformer module that fuses all modalities. All the modules are supervised by their corresponding labels separately, and the forward information flow is uni-directionally from the uni-modal modules to the multi-modal module. The supervision strategy and the model architecture guarantee each individual modality learns its representation independently, and meanwhile the multi-modal module aggregates all information.

We find finetuning large multilingual language models on English tasks with English prompts allows for task genrealization to non-English languages that appear only in the pretraining corpus. Finetuning on multilingual tasks with English prompts further improves performance on English and non-English tasks leading to various state-of-the-art zero-shot results. We also investigate finetuning on multilingual tasks with prompts that have been machine-translated from English to match the language of each dataset. We find training on these machine-translated prompts leads to better performance on human-written prompts in the respective languages. Surprisingly, we find models are capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks in languages they have never intentionally seen. We conjecture that the models are learning higher-level capabilities that are both task- and language-agnostic.

In response, we present Token-Level Self-Evolution Training (SE), a simple and effective dynamic training method to fully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on dynamically learning the under-explored tokens for each forward pass and adaptively regularizes the training by introducing a novel token-specific label smoothing approach. Empirically, SE yields consistent and significant improvements in three tasks, i.e. machine translation, summarization, and grammatical error correction. Encouragingly, we achieve averaging +0.93 BLEU improvement on three machine translation tasks.

With the emergence of new entities and relations in constantly evolving KGs, inductive logical reasoning over KGs has become a crucial problem. However, previous PLMs-based methods struggle to model the logical structures of complex queries, which limits their ability to generalize within the same structure. In this paper, we propose a structure-modeled textual encoding framework for inductive logical reasoning over KGs. It encodes linearized query structures and entities using pre-trained language models to find answers. For structure modeling of complex queries, we design stepwise instructions that implicitly prompt PLMs on the execution order of geometric operations in each query. We further separately model different geometric operations (i.e., projection, intersection, and union) on the representation space using a pre-trained encoder with additional attention and maxout layers to enhance structured modeling. We conduct experiments on two inductive logical reasoning datasets and three transductive datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on logical reasoning over KGs in both inductive and transductive settings.","authors":["SiyuanWang","ZhongyuWei","MengHan","ZhihaoFan","HaijunShan","QiZhang","XuanjingHuang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-question-answering-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2863","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Query Structure Modeling for Inductive Logical Reasoning Over Knowledge Graphs","tldr":"Logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge graphs to answer complex logical queries is a challenging task.

These views of identifiers complement each other and facilitate the holistic ranking of passages from multiple perspectives. We conduct a series of experiments on three public datasets, and the results indicate that our proposed approach performs the best in generative retrieval, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.","authors":["YongqiLi","NanYang","LiangWang","FuruWei","WenjieLi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-information-retrieval-and-text-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2923","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76792/poster_document/0e68e3ccce21c0334208d557d5ebb4e4.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Multiview Identifiers Enhanced Generative Retrieval","tldr":"Instead of simply matching a query to pre-existing passages, generative retrieval generates identifier strings of passages as the retrieval target.

For further study, we create a novel human-to-human mixed-type medical consultation dialogue corpus, termed MidMed, covering four dialogue types: task-oriented dialogue for diagnosis, recommendation, QA, and chitchat. MidMed covers four departments (otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, skin, and digestive system), with 8,309 dialogues. Furthermore, we build benchmarking baselines on MidMed and propose an instruction-guiding medical dialogue generation framework, termed InsMed, to handle mixed-type dialogues.

In this paper, we propose a unified debiasing framework Causal-Debias to remove unwanted stereotypical associations in PLMs during fine-tuning. Specifically, CausalDebias mitigates bias from a causal invariant perspective by leveraging the specific downstream task to identify bias-relevant and labelrelevant factors. We propose that bias-relevant factors are non-causal as they should have little impact on downstream tasks, while labelrelevant factors are causal. We perform interventions on non-causal factors in different demographic groups and design an invariant risk minimization loss to mitigate bias while maintaining task performance. Experimental results on three downstream tasks show that our proposed method can remarkably reduce unwanted stereotypical associations after PLMs are finetuned, while simultaneously minimizing the impact on PLMs and downstream applications.","authors":["FanZhou","YuzhouMao","LiuYu","YiYang","TingZhong"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-ethics-and-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2934","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76794/poster_document/000c82447085a18b0722c558185b1b8c.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Causal-Debias: Unifying Debiasing in Pretrained Language Models and Fine-tuning via Causal Invariant Learning","tldr":"Demographic biases and social stereotypes are common in pretrained language models (PLMs), and a burgeoning body of literature focuses on removing the unwanted stereotypical associations from PLMs. Ho...","track":"Ethics and NLP","underline_id":76794,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76794-causal-debias-unifying-debiasing-in-pretrained-language-models-and-fine-tuning-via-causal-invariant-learning","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52642/file/48e0355a35f318aa7ff2c713b587a197.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085047Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b9ebe26d6f569adeec3930b2a32a060ed122db76946a1dec85214509ed6a6c37"},{"abstract":"Neural architecture search (NAS) has allowed for the automatic creation of new and effective neural network architectures, offering an alternative to the laborious process of manually designing complex architectures. However, traditional NAS algorithms are slow and require immense amounts of computing power. Recent research has investigated training-free NAS metrics for image classification architectures, drastically speeding up search algorithms. In this paper, we investigate training-free NAS metrics for recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT-based transformer architectures, targeted towards language modeling tasks. First, we develop a new training-free metric, named hidden covariance, that predicts the trained performance of an RNN architecture and significantly outperforms existing training-free metrics. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the hidden covariance metric on the NAS-Bench-NLP benchmark. Second, we find that the current search space paradigm for transformer architectures is not optimized for training-free neural architecture search. Instead, a simple qualitative analysis can effectively shrink the search space to the best performing architectures. This conclusion is based on our investigation of existing training-free metrics and new metrics developed from recent transformer pruning literature, evaluated on our own benchmark of trained BERT architectures. Ultimately, our analysis shows that the architecture search space and the training-free metric must be developed together in order to achieve effective results.

This paper proposes a new task to detect commonsense causation between two events in an event sequence (i.e., context), called contextualized commonsense causal reasoning. We also design a zero-shot framework: COLA (Contextualized Commonsense Causality Reasoner) to solve the task from the causal inference perspective.

In this paper, we find that the PLMs already possess the knowledge required to rebut such questions, and the key is how to activate the knowledge. To systematize this observation, we investigate the PLMs' responses to one kind of tricky questions, i.e., the false premises questions (FPQs). We annotate a FalseQA dataset containing 2365 human-written FPQs, with the corresponding explanations for the false premises and the revised true premise questions. Using FalseQA, we discover that PLMs are capable of discriminating FPQs by fine-tuning on moderate numbers (e.g., 256) of examples. PLMs also generate reasonable explanations for the false premise, which serve as rebuttals. Further replaying a few general questions during training allows PLMs to excel on FPQs and general questions simultaneously.

Existing works mainly focus on fusing different features but ignore the challenge of modality heterogeneity. Specifically, different modalities with inherent disparities may bring three problems: 1) introducing redundant visual features during feature fusion; 2) causing feature shift in the representation space; 3) leading to inconsistent annotations for different modal data. All these issues will increase the difficulty in understanding the sentiment of the multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Calibration Network (MVCN) to alleviate the above issues systematically. We first propose a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to reduce the negative impacts of redundant visual elements. We then devise a sentiment-based congruity constraint task to calibrate the feature shift in the representation space. Finally, we introduce an adaptive loss calibration strategy to tackle inconsistent annotated labels.

recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models, these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks such as Winoground. We find that a critical component lacking from current vision-language models is relation-level alignment: the ability to match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., `mug in grass') with spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be enforced by encouraging the language attention from `mug' to `grass' (capturing the semantic relation `in') to match the visual attention from the mug to the grass (capturing the corresponding physical relation). Tokens and their corresponding objects are softly identified using a weighted mean of cross-modal attention. We prove that this notion of soft cross-modal equivalence is equivalent to enforcing congruence between vision and language attention matrices under a `change of basis' provided by the cross-modal attention matrix. Intuitively, our approach projects visual attention into the language attention space to calculate its divergence from the actual language attention, and vice versa. We apply our Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization (CACR) loss to fine-tune UNITER and improve its Winoground Group score by 5.75 points.","authors":["RohanPandey","RulinShao","Paul PuLiang","RuslanSalakhutdinov","Louis-PhilippeMorency"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3065","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76812/poster_document/4ae4b49f86ac3d1f22fd7f53f616c8f4.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Cross-modal Attention Congruence Regularization for Vision-Language Relation Alignment","tldr":"Despite recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models, these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization benchmarks such as Winoground.

However, in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), message passing on a graph is independent from text, resulting in the graph representation hidden space differing from that of the text. This training regime of existing models therefore leads to a semantic gap between graph knowledge and text. In this study, we propose a novel framework for knowledge graph enhanced dialogue generation. We dynamically construct a multi-hop knowledge graph with pseudo nodes to involve the language model in feature aggregation within the graph at all steps. To avoid the semantic biases caused by learning on vanilla subgraphs, the proposed framework applies hierarchical graph attention to aggregate graph features on pseudo nodes and then attains a global feature. Therefore, the framework can better utilise the heterogeneous features from both the post and external graph knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on dialogue generation. Further analysis also shows that our representation learning framework can fill the semantic gap by coagulating representations of both text and graph knowledge. Moreover, the language model also learns how to better select knowledge triples for a more informative response via exploiting subgraph patterns within our feature aggregation process.

In this work we introduce a novel neural language model that enforces, via inductive biases, explicit relational structures which allow for compositionality onto the output representations of pretrained language models. Specifically, the model encodes sentences into sequences of symbols (composed representations), which correspond to the nodes visited by biased random walkers on a global latent graph, and infers the posterior distribution of the latter. We first demonstrate that the model is able to uncover ground-truth graphs from artificially generated datasets of random token sequences. Next, we leverage pretrained BERT and GPT-2 language models as encoder and decoder, respectively, to infer networks of symbols (schemata) from natural language datasets. Our experiments show that (i) the inferred symbols can be interpreted as encoding different aspects of language, as e.g. topics or sentiments, and that (ii) GPT-2-like models can effectively be conditioned on symbolic representations. Finally, we explore training autoregressive, random walk \"reasoning\" models on schema networks inferred from commonsense knowledge databases, and using the sampled paths to enhance the performance of pretrained language models on commonsense If-Then reasoning tasks.","authors":["RamsesJ.Sanchez","LukasAlexanderConrads","PascalWelke","KostadinCvejoski","CesarAliOjeda Marin"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3129","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76824/poster_document/88b2df16328f3ccaf2d9e3ff9c0a79fa.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Hidden Schema Networks","tldr":"Large, pretrained language models infer powerful representations that encode rich semantic and syntactic content, albeit implicitly.

However, where the knowledge hides in KD is still not clear, which may hinder the development of KD. In this work, we first unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly, the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1 information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To address these issues, we propose a new method named Top-1 Information Enhanced Knowledge Distillation (TIE-KD). Specifically, we design a hierarchical ranking loss to enforce the learning of the top-1 information from the teacher. Additionally, we develop an iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the data without ground-truth targets. Experiments on WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 English-Romanian demonstrate that our method can respectively boost Transformer$_{base}$ students by +1.04, +0.60 and +1.11 BLEU scores and significantly outperforms the vanilla word-level KD baseline.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods use the cross-encoder (CE) based architecture. CE concatenates a mention (and its context) with each type and feeds the pair into a pretrained language model (PLM) to score their relevance. It brings deeper interaction between the mention and the type to reach better performance but has to perform $N$ (the type set size) forward passes to infer all the types of a single mention. CE is therefore very slow in inference when the type set is large (e.g., $N=10k$ for UFET). \n\\% Cross-encoder also ignores the correlation between different types.\nTo this end, we propose to perform entity typing in a recall-expand-filter manner.

To account for sociodemographics in models of individual annotator behaviour, we introduce group-specific layers to multi-annotator models.

Solving such a linguistic construction is not a trivial issue in natural language processing since it involves the retrieval of non-overtly expressed verbal material, which might in turn require the model to integrate human-like syntactic and semantic knowledge. In this paper, we explored the issue of how the prototypicality of event participants affects the ability of Language Models (LMs) to handle elliptical sentences and to identify the omitted arguments at different degrees of thematic fit, ranging from highly typical participants to semantically anomalous ones. With this purpose in mind, we built ELLie, the first dataset composed entirely of utterances containing different types of elliptical constructions, and structurally suited for evaluating the effect of argument thematic fit in solving ellipsis and reconstructing the missing element. Our tests demonstrated that the probability scores assigned by the models are higher for typical events than for atypical and impossible ones in different elliptical contexts, confirming the influence of prototypicality of the event participants in interpreting such linguistic structures. Finally, we conducted a retrieval task of the elided verb in the sentence in which the low performance of LMs highlighted a considerable difficulty in reconstructing the correct event.","authors":["DavideTesta","EmmanueleChersoni","AlessandroLenci"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-resources-and-evaluation-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3179","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76830/poster_document/abb37c12aa71e5031cf424af688bc53e.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"We Understand Elliptical Sentences, and Language Models should Too: A New Dataset for Studying Ellipsis and its Interaction with Thematic Fit","tldr":"Ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon characterized by the omission of one or more sentence elements.

Most recent approaches usually involve two steps: (1) modeling entity interactions; (2) decoding entity interactions into events. However, such approaches ignore a global view of inter-dependency of multiple events. Moreover, an event is decoded by iteratively merging its related entities as arguments, which might suffer from error propagation and is computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for document-level multi-event extraction with event proxy nodes and Hausdorff distance minimization. The event proxy nodes, representing pseudo-events, are able to build connections with other event proxy nodes, essentially capturing global information. The Hausdorff distance makes it possible to compare the similarity between the set of predicted events and the set of ground-truth events. By directly minimizing Hausdorff distance, the model is trained towards the global optimum directly, which improves performance and reduces training time. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art method in F1-score on two datasets with only a fraction of training time.","authors":["XinyuWang","LinGui","YulanHe"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3191","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76832/poster_document/44243f9ea43e0913dbb58a01c114d699.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Document-Level Multi-Event Extraction with Event Proxy Nodes and Hausdorff Distance Minimization","tldr":"Document-level multi-event extraction aims to extract the structural information from a given document automatically.

Furthermore, a memory module is designed to preserve the consistency and coherence of generated stories.

This inspires us to approach the final goal of the automatic metrics (human-like evaluations) by fine-grained error analysis.

It contains both location mentions and their types (e.g., district, city). Our extensive analysis shows the decent geographical, domain, location granularity, temporal, and dialectical coverage of IDRISI-RA.

Instead of requesting high-quality yet costly human annotations, it allows training models with noisy annotations obtained from various weak sources. Recently, many sophisticated approaches have been proposed for robust training under label noise, reporting impressive results. In this paper, we revisit the setup of these approaches and find that the benefits brought by these approaches are significantly overestimated. Specifically, we find that the success of existing weakly supervised learning approaches heavily relies on the availability of clean validation samples which, as we show, can be leveraged much more efficiently by simply training on them. After using these clean labels in training, the advantages of using these sophisticated approaches are mostly wiped out. This remains true even when reducing the size of the available clean data to just five samples per class, making these approaches impractical. To understand the true value of weakly supervised learning, we thoroughly analyze diverse NLP datasets and tasks to ascertain when and why weakly supervised approaches work. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future research.","authors":["DaweiZhu","XiaoyuShen","MariusMosbach","AndreasJosephStephan","DietrichKlakow"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-theme_-reality-check-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3227","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76283/poster_document/296e9405b27b718f0195a8662bf13d95.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning","tldr":"Weakly supervised learning is a popular approach for training machine learning models in low-resource settings.

Although methods based on parameter efficient tuning like prefix-tuning could achieve multi-aspect controlling in a plug-and-play way, the mutual interference of multiple prefixes leads to significant degeneration of constraints and limits their extensibility to training-time unseen aspect combinations. In this work, we provide a theoretical lower bound for the interference and empirically found that the interference grows with the number of layers where prefixes are inserted. Based on these analyses, we propose using trainable gates to normalize the intervention of prefixes to restrain the growing interference. As a result, controlling training-time unseen combinations of aspects can be realized by simply concatenating corresponding plugins such that new constraints can be extended at a lower cost. In addition, we propose a unified way to process both categorical and free-form constraints. Experiments on text generation and machine translation demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baselines on constraint accuracy, text quality, and extensibility.","authors":["XuanchengHuang","ZijunLiu","PengLi","TaoLi","MaosongSun","YangLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-generation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3228","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76836/poster_document/8d2e816ba29e9ba6b79db3f0adce860b.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"An Extensible Plug-and-Play Method for Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation","tldr":"Recently, multi-aspect controllable text generation that controls the generated text in multiple aspects (e.g., sentiment, topic, and keywords) has attracted increasing attention.

Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism. Experiments on the SuperGLUE and NER datasets show the effectiveness of APT.

Knowledge distillation finds a path to compress LMs to small ones with a teacher-student paradigm. However, when the capacity gap between the teacher and the student is large, a curse of capacity gap appears, invoking a deficiency in distilling LMs. While a few studies have been carried out to fill the gap, the curse is not yet well tackled. In this paper, we aim at lifting the curse of capacity gap via enlarging the capacity of the student without notably increasing the inference compute. Largely motivated by sparse activation regime of mixture of experts (MoE), we propose a mixture of minimal experts (MiniMoE), which imposes extra parameters to the student but introduces almost no additional inference compute. Experimental results on GLUE and CoNLL demonstrate the curse of capacity gap is lifted by the magic of MiniMoE to a large extent. MiniMoE also achieves the state-of-the-art performance at small FLOPs compared with a range of competitive baselines. With a compression rate as much as $\\sim$50$\\times$, MiniMoE preserves $\\sim$95\\% GLUE score of the teacher.","authors":["ChenZhang","YangYang","JiahaoLiu","JingangWang","YunsenXian","BenyouWang","DaweiSong"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3267","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76286/poster_document/e9726304dd18bc1e9eb67b4080b21337.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Lifting the Curse of Capacity Gap in Distilling Language Models","tldr":"Pretrained language models (LMs) have shown compelling performance on various downstream tasks, but unfortunately they require a tremendous amount of inference compute.

In this study, we investigate whether data augmentation techniques could help improve low-resource ASR performance, focusing on four typologically diverse minority languages or language variants (West Germanic: Gronings, West-Frisian; Malayo-Polynesian: Besemah, Nasal). For all four languages, we examine the use of self-training, where an ASR system trained with the available human-transcribed data is used to generate transcriptions, which are then combined with the original data to train a new ASR system. For Gronings, for which there was a pre-existing text-to-speech (TTS) system available, we also examined the use of TTS to generate ASR training data from text-only sources. We find that using a self-training approach consistently yields improved performance (a relative WER reduction up to 20.5\\% compared to using an ASR system trained on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). The performance gain from TTS augmentation for Gronings was even stronger (up to 25.5\\% relative reduction in WER compared to a system based on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). In sum, our results show the benefit of using self-training or (if possible) TTS-generated data as an efficient solution to overcome the limitations of data availability for resource-scarce languages in order to improve ASR performance.","authors":["MartijnBartelds","NaySan","BradleyMcDonnell","DanJurafsky","MartijnWieling"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-speech-and-multimodality-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3291","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76287/poster_document/7dc2245da1cd11248720254f6794d979.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Making More of Little Data: Improving Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition Using Data Augmentation","tldr":"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has advanced substantially in recent years, particularly for languages for which a large amount of transcribed speech is available.

We learn binary masks to select different sub-networks from the prototype network and apply them as PETL modules into different layers. We find that the binary masks can determine crucial structural information from the network, which is often ignored in previous studies. Our work can also be seen as a type of pruning method, where we find that overparameterization also exists in the seemingly small PETL modules.

This task spans a variety of domains ranging from social media opinion identification to detecting the stance for a legal claim. However, the framing of the task varies within these domains in terms of the data collection protocol, the label dictionary and the number of available annotations. Furthermore, these stance annotations are significantly imbalanced on a per-topic and inter-topic basis. These make multi-domain stance detection challenging, requiring standardization and domain adaptation. To overcome this challenge, we propose Topic Efficient StancE Detection (TESTED), consisting of a topic-guided diversity sampling technique used for creating a multi-domain data efficient training set and a contrastive objective that is used for fine-tuning a stance classifier using the produced set. We evaluate the method on an existing benchmark of 16 datasets with in-domain, i.e. all topics seen and out-of-domain, i.e. unseen topics, experiments. The results show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average of 3.5 F1 points increase in-domain and is more generalizable with an averaged 10.2 F1 on out-of-domain evaluation while using <10\\% of the training data. We show that our sampling technique mitigates both inter- and per-topic class imbalances. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that the contrastive learning objective allows the model for a more pronounced segmentation of samples with varying labels.","authors":["ErikArakelyan","ArnavArora","IsabelleAugenstein"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3327","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76289/poster_document/3d28d92c08ffb315658ab911a3527311.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Topic-Guided Sampling For Data-Efficient Multi-Domain Stance Detection","tldr":"The task of Stance Detection is concerned with identifying the attitudes expressed by an author towards a target of interest.

Since labeled data only exists in the source domain, a model is expected to bridge the domain gap for tackling cross-domain ABSA. Though domain adaptation methods have proven to be effective, most of them are based on a discriminative model, which needs to be specifically designed for different ABSA tasks. To offer a more general solution, we propose a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain ABSA tasks. Specifically, our framework trains a generative model in both text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain ABSA tasks and present new state-of-the-art results on all tasks.

Specifically, 1) with the design of a text encoder and a prosody encoder, we encourage the model to connect the text context with its corresponding prosody pattern in the joint multi-modal space; 2) we introduce a multi-scale pre-training pipeline to capture prosody patterns in multiple levels. 3) we show how to incorporate CLAPSpeech into existing TTS models for better prosody. Experiments on three datasets not only show that CLAPSpeech could improve the prosody prediction for existing TTS methods, but also demonstrate its generalization ability to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech.

Our hypothesis is that the insensitivity can be attributed to the weight sum operation utilized in the attention module.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic heterogeneous-graph reasoning method with LMs and knowledge representation learning (DHLK), which constructs a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG) based on multiple knowledge sources and optimizes the structure and knowledge representation of the HKG using a two-stage pruning strategy and knowledge representation learning (KRL). It then performs joint reasoning by LMs and Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA). Specifically, DHLK filters key entities based on the dictionary vocabulary to achieve the first-stage pruning while incorporating the paraphrases in the dictionary into the subgraph to construct the HKG. Then, DHLK encodes and fuses the QA context and HKG using LM, and dynamically removes irrelevant KG entities based on the attention weights of LM for the second-stage pruning. Finally, DHLK introduces KRL to optimize the knowledge representation and perform answer reasoning on the HKG by RMSA.We evaluate DHLK at CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, and show its improvement on existing LM and LM+KG methods.","authors":["YujieWang","HuZhang","JiyeLiang","RuLi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3418","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76865/poster_document/02244cacdefad8e46eeb0a01f8dafab3.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense Question Answering","tldr":"Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have won noteworthy success in commonsense question answering.

Instead, our approach adopts a ``coarse-to-fine'' process, in which the video can be generated in parallel at the same granularity. A global diffusion model is applied to generate the keyframes across the entire time range, and then local diffusion models recursively fill in the content between nearby frames.

To evaluate our model, we build FlintstonesHD dataset, a new benchmark for long video generation.

We found that diversification approaches can increase data diversity but often at the cost of data accuracy (i.e., text and labels being appropriate for the target domain).

With oracle studies, we found that LR increases the absolute accuracy of models trained with diversified datasets by 14.4\\%. Moreover, we found that some models trained with data generated with LR interventions outperformed LLM-based few-shot classification.

Particularly, the anisotropy of such representations has been observed, which means that the directions of the word vectors are not evenly distributed across the space but rather concentrated in a narrow cone. This has led to several attempts to counteract this phenomenon both on static and contextualized text representations. However, despite this effort, there is no established relationship between anisotropy and performance. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the impact of different transformations on both the isotropy and the performance in order to assess the true impact of anisotropy. To this end, we rely on the clustering task as a means of evaluating the ability of text representations to produce meaningful groups. Thereby, we empirically show a limited impact of anisotropy on the expressiveness of sentence representations both in terms of directions and L2 closeness.","authors":["MiraAit-Saada","MohamedNadif"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-theme_-reality-check-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3472","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76872/poster_document/578c78686bcfb30f91871cb24826d1d5.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Is Anisotropy Truly Harmful?

Data sparsity is the main challenge in building CS-based dialogue systems, particularly in the Chinese language. To fill this gap, we construct a Chinese CS conversation (CSConv) dataset, which contains about 2.6K groups of dialogues with therapy principles and emotional support strategy labels.  Making chit chat while providing emotional support is overlooked by the majority of existing cognitive dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-source knowledge fusion method for CS dialogue (CSD), to generate open-ended responses guided by the therapy principle and emotional support strategy. We first use a progressive mask method based on external knowledge to learn encoders as effective classifiers, which is the prerequisite to predict the therapy principle and emotional support strategy of the target response. Then a decoder interacts with the perceived therapy principle and emotional support strategy to generate responses. Extensive experiments conducted on the CSConv dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while there is still a large space for improvement compared to human performance.","authors":["JiyueJiang","ShengWang","QintongLi","LingpengKong","ChuanWu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3487","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76874/poster_document/acaf1694d2606771136db4133ddfcfe1.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A Cognitive Stimulation Dialogue System with Multi-source Knowledge Fusion for Elders with Cognitive Impairment","tldr":"When communicating with elders with cognitive impairment, cognitive stimulation (CS) help to maintain the cognitive health of elders.

To address these needs, we present a benchmark of unfaithful minimal pairs (BUMP), a dataset of 889 human-written, minimally different summary pairs, where a single error is introduced to a summary from the CNN/DailyMail dataset to produce an unfaithful summary. We find BUMP complements existing benchmarks in a number of ways: 1) the summaries in BUMP are harder to discriminate and less probable under SOTA summarization models, 2) unlike non-pair-based datasets, BUMP can be used to measure the consistency of metrics, and reveals that the most discriminative metrics tend not to be the most consistent, and 3) unlike datasets containing generated summaries with multiple errors, BUMP enables the measurement of metrics' performance on individual error types.","authors":["LiangMa","ShuyangCao","Robert LLogan IV","DiLu","ShihaoRan","KeZhang","JoelTetreault","AlejandroJaimes"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3495","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76876/poster_document/e00e0b1ba11ce8254403549086297729.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"BUMP: A Benchmark of Unfaithful Minimal Pairs for Meta-Evaluation of Faithfulness Metrics","tldr":"The proliferation of automatic faithfulness metrics for summarization has produced a need for benchmarks to evaluate them.

To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning.

In recent literature, auxiliary data has been used to improve prediction accuracy, such as textual news. When predicting a particular stock, we assume that information from other stocks should also be utilized as auxiliary data to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose the Causality-guided Multi-memory Interaction Network (CMIN), a novel end-to-end deep neural network for stock movement prediction which, for the first time, models the multi-modality between financial text data and causality-enhanced stock correlations to achieve higher prediction accuracy. CMIN transforms the basic attention mechanism into Causal Attention by calculating transfer entropy between multivariate stocks in order to avoid attention on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we introduce a fusion mechanism to model the multi-directional interactions through which CMIN learns not only the self-influence but also the interactive influence in information flows representing the interrelationship between text and stock correlations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experiments on three real-world datasets collected from the U.S. and Chinese markets, where CMIN outperforms existing models to establish a new state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.","authors":["DiLuo","WeihengLiao","ShuqiLi","XinCheng","RuiYan"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3625","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76892/poster_document/7e5079e7d9f5ff512798e54717d3b9c0.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Causality-Guided Multi-Memory Interaction Network for Multivariate Stock Price Movement Prediction","tldr":"Over the past few years, we've witnessed an enormous interest in stock price movement prediction using AI techniques.

However, it is unclear how well models that are trained on this 20-year-old data and developed over a period of decades using the same test set will perform when applied on modern data. In this paper, we evaluate the generalization of over 20 different models trained on CoNLL-2003, and show that NER models have very different generalization. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of performance degradation in pre-trained Transformers, such as RoBERTa and T5, even when fine-tuned using decades-old data. We investigate why some models generalize well to new data while others do not, and attempt to disentangle the effects of temporal drift and overfitting due to test reuse. Our analysis suggests that most deterioration is due to temporal mismatch between the pre-training corpora and the downstream test sets. We found that four factors are important for good generalization: model architecture, number of parameters, time period of the pre-training corpus, in addition to the amount of fine-tuning data. We suggest current evaluation methods have, in some sense, underestimated progress on NER over the past 20 years, as NER models have not only improved on the original CoNLL-2003 test set, but improved even more on modern data.

This entails that adversarial perturbations would not pass any human quality gate and do not represent real threats to human-checked NLP systems. To bypass this limitation and enable proper assessment (and later, improvement) of NLP model robustness, we have surveyed 378 human participants about the perceptibility of text adversarial examples produced by state-of-the-art methods. Our results underline that existing text attacks are impractical in real-world scenarios where humans are involved. This contrasts with previous smaller-scale human studies, which reported overly optimistic conclusions regarding attack success.

Our best syntactic evaluation datasets, however, provide substantially less linguistic context than models receive during pretraining. This mismatch raises an important question: how robust are models' syntactic judgements across different contexts? In this paper, we vary the input contexts based on: length, the types of syntactic phenomena it contains, and whether or not there are grammatical violations. We find that model judgements are generally robust when placed in randomly sampled linguistic contexts, but are unstable when contexts match the test stimuli in syntactic structure. Among all tested models (GPT-2 and five variants of OPT), we find that model performance is affected when we provided contexts with matching syntactic structure: performance significantly improves when contexts are acceptable, and it significantly declines when they are unacceptable. This effect is amplified by the length of the context, except for unrelated inputs. We show that these changes in model performance are not explainable by acceptability-preserving syntactic perturbations. This sensitivity to highly specific syntactic features of the context can only be explained by the models' implicit in-context learning abilities.","authors":["KoustuvSinha","JonGauthier","AaronMueller","KanishkaMisra","KerenFuentes","RogerLevy","AdinaWilliams"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3760","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76915/poster_document/9cccc7edc4edcd4053746b95451ddcf2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context","tldr":"Targeted syntactic evaluations of language models ask whether models show stable preferences for syntactically acceptable content over minimal-pair unacceptable inputs.

The provided corpora include named entity recognition datasets of diverse genres, including Wikipedia articles and supplement products customer reviews. In addition, crawling e-commerce and movie reviews websites, we compiled several sentiment analysis datasets of different genres. Our linguistic resources for Turkish also include pretrained spaCy language models. To the best of our knowledge, our models are the first spaCy models trained for the Turkish language. Finally, we provide various types of education material, such as video tutorials and code examples, that can support the interested audience on practicing Turkish NLP. The advantages of our linguistic resources are three-fold: they are freely available, they are first of their kind, and they are easy to use in a broad range of implementations.

However, there is a crucial lack of annotated meeting corpora for developing this technology, as it can be hard to collect meetings, especially when the topics discussed are confidential. Furthermore, meeting summaries written by experienced writers are scarce, making it hard for abstractive summarizers to produce sensible output without a reliable reference. This lack of annotated corpora has hindered the development of meeting summarization technology. In this paper, we present MeetingBank, a new benchmark dataset of city council meetings over the past decade. MeetingBank is unique among other meeting corpora due to its divide-and-conquer approach, which involves dividing professionally written meeting minutes into shorter passages and aligning them with specific segments of the meeting. This breaks down the process of summarizing a lengthy meeting into smaller, more manageable tasks. The dataset provides a new testbed of various meeting summarization systems and also allows the public to gain insight into how council decisions are made. We make the collection, including meeting video links, transcripts, reference summaries, agenda, and other metadata, publicly available to facilitate the development of better meeting summarization techniques.","authors":["YebowenHu","TimothyJeewunGanter","HaniehDeilamsalehy","FranckDernoncourt","HassanForoosh","FeiLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-summarization-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3774","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76919/poster_document/24ff3bed60f2988eb8c6b7952c024404.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"MeetingBank: A Benchmark Dataset for Meeting Summarization","tldr":"As the number of recorded meetings increases, it becomes increasingly important to utilize summarization technology to create useful summaries of these recordings.

While many studies discuss these design choices, there have been few systematic investigations into categorizing them and mitigating their impact. In this work, we define a typology for three types of label biases in ICL for text classification: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias (which we conceptualize and detect for the first time). \n\nOur analysis demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fall short of addressing all three types of biases. Specifically, domain-label bias restricts LLMs to random-level performance on many tasks regardless of the choice of in-context examples.  To mitigate the effect of these biases, we propose a simple bias calibration method that estimates a language model's label bias using random in-domain words from the task corpus. After controlling for this estimated bias when making predictions, our novel domain-context calibration significantly improves the ICL performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 on a wide range of tasks. The gain is substantial on tasks with large domain-label bias (up to 37\\% in Macro-F1). Furthermore, our results generalize to models with different scales, pretraining methods, and manually-designed task instructions, showing the prevalence of label biases in ICL.","authors":["YuFei","YifanHou","ZemingChen","AntoineBosselut"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3786","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76922/poster_document/19a1eb677ffad8cce94f304fc609fd08.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Mitigating Label Biases for In-context Learning","tldr":"Various design settings for in-context learning (ICL), such as the choice and order of the in-context examples, can bias the model's predictions.

However, existing human evaluation studies for summarization either exhibit a low inter-annotator agreement or have insufficient scale, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is lacking. Therefore, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization evaluation along the following axes: (1) We propose a modified summarization salience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which is based on fine-grained semantic units and allows for a high inter-annotator agreement. (2) We curate the Robust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation dataset consisting of 22,000 summary-level annotations over 28 top-performing systems on three datasets. (3) We conduct a comparative study of four human evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in evaluation setups.

The metrics we benchmarked include recent methods based on large language models (LLMs), GPTScore and G-Eval. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating LLMs, as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g., GPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the annotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust, targeted evaluation methods.","authors":["YixinLiu","AlexFabbri","PengfeiLiu","YilunZhao","LinyongNan","RuilinHan","SimengHan","ShafiqJoty","Chien-ShengJasonWu","CaimingXiong","DragomirRadev"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-summarization-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3833","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76307/poster_document/06318a04bf72ac247795045cf135a3b6.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Revisiting the Gold Standard: Grounding Summarization Evaluation with Robust Human Evaluation","tldr":"Human evaluation is the foundation upon which the evaluation of both summarization systems and automatic metrics rests.

We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily on text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several training/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits, we find that even when evaluated on a different set of entities from training or longer operation sequences, a finetuned model can perform non-trivial entity tracking.

To this end, we propose a simple yet effective attacking framework, SAME, a novel slowdown attack framework on multi-exit models, which is specially tailored to reduce the efficiency of the multi-exit models.

Task-oriented dialogue systems use task schema, which is a set of task attributes, to encode the user's task goals. Existing studies on USM neglect explicitly modeling the user's task goals fulfillment using the task schema. In this paper, we propose SG-USM, a novel schema-guided user satisfaction modeling framework. It explicitly models the degree to which the user's preferences regarding the task attributes are fulfilled by the system for predicting the user's satisfaction level. SG-USM employs a pre-trained language model for encoding dialogue context and task attributes. Further, it employs a fulfillment representation layer for learning how many task attributes have been fulfilled in the dialogue, an importance predictor component for calculating the importance of task attributes. Finally, it predicts the user satisfaction based on task attribute fulfillment and task attribute importance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e. MWOZ, SGD, ReDial, and JDDC) show that SG-USM consistently outperforms competitive existing methods. Our extensive analysis demonstrates that SG-USM can improve the interpretability of user satisfaction modeling, has good scalability as it can effectively deal with unseen tasks and can also effectively work in low-resource settings by leveraging unlabeled data.{Code is available at {https://github.com/amzn/user-satisfaction-modeling}.}","authors":["YueFeng","YunlongJiao","AnimeshPrasad","NikolaosAletras","EmineYilmaz","GabriellaKazai"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P3945","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Schema-Guided User Satisfaction Modeling for Task-Oriented Dialogues","tldr":"User Satisfaction Modeling (USM) is one of the popular choices for task-oriented dialogue systems evaluation, where user satisfaction typically depends on whether the user's task goals were fulfilled ...","track":"Dialogue and Interactive Systems","underline_id":76313,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76313-schema-guided-user-satisfaction-modeling-for-task-oriented-dialogues","video_url":null},{"abstract":"In this work, we address the NER problem by splitting it into two logical sub-tasks: (1) Span Detection which simply extracts entity mention spans irrespective of entity type; (2) Span Classification which classifies the spans into their entity types.

Then we organize these semantically meaningful conversation snippets compositionally to create new training instances.\nAdditionally, we explore noise-tolerant settings in both self-training and joint-training paradigms to make the most of these augmented samples. \nOur experiments on benchmark datasets, SAMSum and DialogSum, show that \\textsc{Compo} substantially outperforms prior baseline methods by achieving a nearly 10\\% increase of ROUGE scores with limited data.

However, providing a faithful vector-based explanation for a multi-layer model could be challenging in three aspects: (1) Incorporating all components into the analysis, (2) Aggregating the layer dynamics to determine the information flow and mixture throughout the entire model, and (3) Identifying the connection between the vector-based analysis and the model's predictions. In this paper, we present DecompX to tackle these challenges. DecompX is based on the construction of decomposed token representations and their successive propagation throughout the model without mixing them in between layers. Additionally, our proposal provides multiple advantages over existing solutions for its inclusion of all encoder components (especially nonlinear feed-forward networks) and the classification head. The former allows acquiring precise vectors while the latter transforms the decomposition into meaningful prediction-based values, eliminating the need for norm- or summation-based vector aggregation.

In practice, however, the input text of many NLP tasks can be seen as a sequence of related segments (e.g., the sequence of sentences within a passage, or the hypothesis and premise in NLI). While attending across these segments is highly beneficial for many tasks, we hypothesize that this interaction can be delayed until later encoding stages.\n\nTo this end, we introduce Layer-Adjustable Interactions in Transformers (LAIT). Within LAIT, segmented inputs are first encoded independently, and then jointly. This partial two-tower architecture bridges the gap between a Dual Encoder's ability to pre-compute representations for segments and a fully self-attentive Transformer's capacity to model cross-segment attention. The LAIT framework effectively leverages existing pretrained Transformers and converts them into the hybrid of the two aforementioned architectures, allowing for easy and intuitive control over the performance-efficiency tradeoff. Experimenting on a wide range of NLP tasks, we find LAIT able to reduce 30-50\\% of the attention FLOPs on many tasks, while preserving high accuracy; in some practical settings, LAIT could reduce actual latency by orders of magnitude.","authors":["JeremiahMilbauer","AnnieLouis","Mohammad JavadHosseini","AlexFabrikant","DonaldMetzler","TalSchuster"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3962","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76947/poster_document/2875c20c6eb5a7fc94bf9c0a508215c0.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"LAIT: Efficient Multi-Segment Encoding in Transformers with Layer-Adjustable Interaction","tldr":"Transformer encoders contextualize token representations by attending to all other tokens at each layer, leading to quadratic increase in compute effort with the input length.

Contemporary automatic fact-checking systems focus on estimating truthfulness using numerical scores which are not human-interpretable. A human fact-checker generally follows several logical steps to verify a verisimilitude claim and conclude whether it's truthful or a mere masquerade. Popular fact-checking websites follow a common structure for fact categorization such as half true, half false, false, pants on fire, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to have an aspect-based (delineating which part(s) are true and which are false) explainable system that can assist human fact-checkers in asking relevant questions related to a fact, which can then be validated separately to reach a final verdict. In this paper, we propose a 5W framework (who, what, when, where, and why) for question-answer-based fact explainability. To that end, we present a semi-automatically generated dataset called FACTIFY-5WQA, which consists of 391, 041 facts along with relevant 5W QAs \u2013 underscoring our major contribution to this paper. A semantic role labeling system has been utilized to locate 5Ws, which generates QA pairs for claims using a masked language model. Finally, we report a baseline QA system to automatically locate those answers from evidence documents, which can serve as a baseline for future research in the field.

By leveraging data from multiple clients, the FL paradigm can be especially beneficial for clients that have little training data to develop a data-hungry neural semantic parser on their own. We propose an evaluation setup to study this task, where we re-purpose widely-used single-domain text-to-SQL datasets as clients to form a realistic heterogeneous FL setting and collaboratively train a global model. As standard FL algorithms suffer from the high client heterogeneity in our realistic setup, we further propose a novel LOss Reduction Adjusted Re-weighting (Lorar) mechanism, which adjusts each client's contribution to the global model update based on its training loss reduction during each round. Our intuition is that the larger the loss reduction, the further away the current global model is from the client's local optimum, and the larger weight the client should get. By applying Lorar to three widely adopted FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedOPT and FedProx), we observe that their performance can be improved substantially on average (4\\%-20\\% absolute gain under MacroAvg) and that clients with smaller datasets enjoy larger performance gains. In addition, the global model converges faster for almost all the clients.","authors":["TianshuZhang","ChangchangLiu","Wei-HanLee","YuSu","HuanSun"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-semantics_-lexical-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4106","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76969/poster_document/41b4fb283a0dfc0d08c5c29d501d64c1.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Federated Learning for Semantic Parsing: Task Formulation, Evaluation Setup, New Algorithms","tldr":"This paper studies a new task of federated learning (FL) for semantic parsing, where multiple clients collaboratively train one global model without sharing their semantic parsing data.

To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we perform extensive experiments to compare MetaAdapt with state-of-the-art baselines and large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, where MetaAdapt achieves better performance in domain adaptive few-shot misinformation detection with substantially reduced parameters on real-world datasets.","authors":["ZhenruiYue","HuiminZeng","YangZhang","LanyuShang","DongWang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4130","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76971/poster_document/379bd325da8eb450bd47db577527d385.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"MetaAdapt: Domain Adaptive Few-Shot Misinformation Detection via Meta Learning","tldr":"With emerging topics (e.g., COVID-19) on social media as a source for the spreading misinformation, overcoming the distributional shifts between the original training domain (i.e., source domain) and ...","track":"Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics","underline_id":76971,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76971-metaadapt-domain-adaptive-few-shot-misinformation-detection-via-meta-learning","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Sampling-based decoding strategies are widely employed for generating text from probabilistic models, yet standard ancestral sampling often results in text that is degenerate or incoherent. To alleviate this issue, various modifications to a model's sampling distribution, such as top-p or top-k sampling, have been introduced and are now ubiquitously used in language generation systems. We propose a unified framework for understanding these techniques, which we term sampling adapters. Sampling adapters often lead to qualitatively better text, which raises the question: From a formal perspective, how are they changing the token-level distributions of language generation models? And why do these local changes lead to higher-quality text?  We argue that the shift they enforce can be viewed as a trade-off between precision and recall: while the model loses its ability to produce certain strings, its precision rate on desirable text increases.  While this trade-off is not reflected in standard metrics of distribution quality (such as perplexity), we find that several precision-emphasizing measures indeed indicate that sampling adapters can lead to probability distributions more aligned with the true distribution. Further, these measures correlate with higher sequence-level quality scores, specifically, Mauve.","authors":["ClaraMeister","TiagoPimentel","LucaMalagutti","EthanWilcox","RyanCotterell"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-generation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4136","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76972/poster_document/2cc0ea89e46a419aab3b4f1aceefd5c2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"On the Efficacy of Sampling Adapters","tldr":"Sampling-based decoding strategies are widely employed for generating text from probabilistic models, yet standard ancestral sampling often results in text that is degenerate or incoherent.

The use of such a heuristic raises the question: Can we initialise our models with this behaviour and save precious compute resources and model capacity? Here we show that we can effectively endow standard neural language generation models with a separate module that reflects unigram frequency statistics as prior knowledge, simply by initialising the bias term in a model's final linear layer with the log-unigram distribution. We use  neural machine translation as a test bed for this simple technique and observe that it: (i) improves learning efficiency; (ii) achieves better overall performance; and perhaps most importantly (iii) appears to disentangle strong frequency effects by encouraging the model to specialise in non-frequency-related aspects of language.","authors":["ClaraMeister","WojciechJanStokowiec","TiagoPimentel","LeiYu","LauraRimell","AdhigunaKuncoro"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4155","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76974/poster_document/494a54ae0ae98ef394e50edb6b435305.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A Natural Bias for Language Generation Models","tldr":"After just a few hundred training updates, a standard probabilistic model for language generation has likely not yet learnt many semantic or syntactic rules of natural language, making it difficult to...","track":"Generation","underline_id":76974,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76974-a-natural-bias-for-language-generation-models","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Standard decoding approaches for conditional text generation tasks typically search for an output hypothesis with high model probability, but this may not yield the best hypothesis according to human judgments of quality. Reranking to optimize for \"downstream\" metrics can more closely optimize for quality, but many metrics of interest are computed with pre-trained language models, which are slow to apply to large numbers of hypotheses. We explore an approach for reranking hypotheses by using Transformers to efficiently encode lattices of generated outputs, a method we call EEL. With a single Transformer pass over the entire lattice, we can approximately compute a contextualized representation of each token as if it were only part of a single hypothesis in isolation. We combine this approach with a new class of token-factored rerankers (TFRs) that allow for efficient extraction of high reranker-scoring hypotheses from the lattice. Empirically, our approach incurs minimal degradation error compared to the exponentially slower approach of encoding each hypothesis individually. When applying EEL with TFRs across three text generation tasks, our results show both substantial speedup compared to naive reranking and often better performance on downstream metrics than comparable approaches.","authors":["PrasannSinghal","JiachengXu","XiYe","GregDurrett"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-generation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4157","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76975/poster_document/0db51fb8de985548f5ee970cf0215fd5.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"EEL: Efficiently Encoding Lattices for Reranking","tldr":"Standard decoding approaches for conditional text generation tasks typically search for an output hypothesis with high model probability, but this may not yield the best hypothesis according to human ...","track":"Generation","underline_id":76975,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76975-eel-efficiently-encoding-lattices-for-reranking","video_url":null},{"abstract":"This paper presents an information-theoretical model of syntactic generalization.

We test abstraction as an optimization objective on the task of inducing syntactic categories from natural language data and show that it significantly outperforms alternative methods.

Our models generate coherent, semantically rich captions and perform on par with state-of-the-art chart captioning models across machine translation and text generation metrics.

Prior research has analyzed characters and locations from text independently without grounding characters to their locations in narrative time.

The objective of the task is to assign a spatial relationship category for every character and location co-mention within a window of text, taking into consideration linguistic context, narrative tense, and temporal scope. To this end, we annotate spatial relationships in approximately $2500$ book excerpts and train a model using contextual embeddings as features to predict these relationships. When applied to a set of books, this model allows us to test several hypotheses on mobility and domestic space, revealing that protagonists are more mobile than non-central characters and that women as characters tend to occupy more interior space than men.

We show that DeFacto can provide factually consistent human-edited summaries and further insights into summarization factual consistency thanks to its informational natural language feedback. We further demonstrate that fine-tuned language models can leverage our dataset to improve the summary factual consistency, while large language models lack the zero-shot learning ability in our proposed tasks that require controllable text generation.","authors":["YixinLiu","BudhadityaDeb","MilagroTeruel","AaronL.Halfaker","DragomirRadev","Ahmed HassanAwadallah"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-summarization-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4192","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76981/poster_document/86138470908e87bc13f5da5d6c9079bb.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"On Improving Summarization Factual Consistency from Natural Language Feedback","tldr":"Despite the recent progress in language generation models, their outputs may not always meet user expectations.

We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using conditional V-information (Hewitt et al., 2021).

Experiments across four benchmarks with reasoning tasks, including chain-of-thought, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. We further demonstrate REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale evaluations and provides more sensitive measurements of new information in free-text rationales. When used alongside traditional performance metrics, REV provides deeper insights into models' reasoning and prediction processes.","authors":["HanjieChen","FaezeBrahman","XiangRen","YangfengJi","YejinChoi","SwabhaSwayamdipta"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4234","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76991/poster_document/a6811cdfa9c4d782aa35095d529895be.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"REV: Information-Theoretic Evaluation of Free-Text Rationales","tldr":"Generating free-text rationales is a promising step towards explainable NLP, yet evaluating such rationales remains a challenge.

Distant supervision (DS) is able to generate massive auto-labeled data, which can improve DocRE performance. Recent works leverage pseudo labels generated by the pre-denoising model to reduce noise in DS data. However, unreliable pseudo labels bring new noise, e.g., adding false pseudo labels and losing correct DS labels. Therefore, how to select effective pseudo labels to denoise DS data is still a challenge in document-level distant relation extraction. To tackle this issue, we introduce uncertainty estimation technology to determine whether pseudo labels can be trusted. In this work, we propose a Document-level distant Relation Extraction framework with Uncertainty Guided label denoising, UGDRE. Specifically, we propose a novel instance-level uncertainty estimation method, which measures the reliability of the pseudo labels with overlapping relations. By further considering the long-tail problem, we design dynamic uncertainty thresholds for different types of relations to filter high-uncertainty pseudo labels. We conduct experiments on two public datasets.

Recent works usually propose sophisticated models for each task independently and pay less attention to the commonality of these tasks and to have a unified framework for all the tasks. In this work, we propose to take a unified view of all these tasks and introduce TAGPRIME to address relational structure extraction problems. TAGPRIME is a sequence tagging model that appends priming words about the information of the given condition (such as an event trigger) to the input text. With the self-attention mechanism in pre-trained language models, the priming words make the output contextualized representations contain more information about the given condition, and hence become more suitable for extracting specific relationships for the condition. Extensive experiments and analyses on three different tasks that cover ten datasets across five different languages demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of TAGPRIME.","authors":["I-HungHsu","Kuan-HaoHuang","ShuningZhang","WenxinCheng","PremNatarajan","Kai-WeiChang","NanyunPeng"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-information-extraction-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P4372","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76330/poster_document/3db21d788cfd12b85be57ef5d0dbe2bf.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"TAGPRIME: A Unified Framework for Relational Structure Extraction","tldr":"Many tasks in natural language processing require the extraction of relationship information for a given condition, such as event argument extraction, relation extraction, and task-oriented semantic p...","track":"Information Extraction","underline_id":76330,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76330-tagprime-a-unified-framework-for-relational-structure-extraction","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Sustaining coherent and engaging narratives requires dialogue or storytelling agents to understand\nhow the personas of speakers or listeners ground the narrative.

FairPrism aims to address several limitations of existing datasets for measuring and mitigating fairness-related harms, including improved transparency, clearer specification of dataset coverage, and accounting for annotator disagreement and harms that are context-dependent. FairPrism's annotations include the extent of stereotyping and demeaning harms, the demographic groups targeted, and appropriateness for different applications. The annotations also include specific harms that occur in interactive contexts and harms that raise normative concerns when the \"speaker\" is an AI system. Due to its precision and granularity, FairPrism can be used to diagnose (1) the types of fairness-related harms that AI text generation systems cause, and (2) the potential limitations of mitigation methods, both of which we illustrate through case studies.

On the other hand, neuro-symbolic methods, specifically those that leverage an intermediate formal representation, are gaining significant attention in language understanding tasks. This is because of their advantages ranging from inherent interpretability, the lesser requirement of training data, and being generalizable in scenarios with unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a modular, NEuro-Symbolic Textual Agent (NESTA) that combines a generic semantic parser with a rule induction system to learn abstract interpretable rules as policies.

It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics. The training data is limited as most songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned melody-lyric data.  Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics. The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from inference (melody-guided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of parallel data.\n\nWe leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during inference. The two-step hierarchical design also enables content control via the lyric outline, a much-desired feature for democratizing collaborative song creation.

Automatic analysis of conversations---at the full chat and utterance levels---may help support counselors and provide better care. While some session-level training data (e.g., rating of patient risk) is often available from counselors, labeling utterances requires expensive post hoc annotation. But the latter can not only provide insights about conversation dynamics, but can also serve to support quality assurance efforts for counselors. In this paper, we examine if inexpensive---and potentially noisy---session-level annotation can help improve label utterances. To this end, we propose a logic-based indirect supervision approach that exploits declaratively stated structural dependencies between both levels of annotation to improve utterance modeling. We show that adding these rules gives an improvement of 3.5\\% f-score over a strong multi-task baseline for utterance-level predictions. We demonstrate via ablation studies how indirect supervision via logic rules also improves the consistency and robustness of the system.","authors":["MattiaMedina Grespan","MeghanBroadbent","XinyaoZhang","KatherineE.Axford","BrentKious","ZacImel","VivekSrikumar"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4462","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77022/poster_document/987af2ee534ed6a6d9d0e241ddfd18f1.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Logic-driven Indirect Supervision: An Application to Crisis Counseling","tldr":"Ensuring the effectiveness of text-based crisis counseling requires observing ongoing conversations and providing feedback, both labor-intensive tasks.

Because these analyses are often conducted manually and at a small scale, such investigations can benefit from the use of more recent natural language processing (NLP) methods that examine social bias in models and data corpora. Our work joins this interdisciplinary effort and makes a unique contribution by taking into account the event narrative structures when analyzing the social bias of stories. We propose a computational pipeline that automatically extracts a story's temporal narrative verb-based event chain for each of its characters as well as character attributes such as gender. We also present a verb-based event annotation scheme that can facilitate bias analysis by including categories such as those that align with traditional stereotypes. Through a case study analyzing gender bias in fairy tales, we demonstrate that our framework can reveal bias in not only the unigram verb-based events in which female and male characters participate but also in the temporal narrative order of such event participation.","authors":["PaulinaToro Isaza","GuangxuanXu","ToyeOloko","YufangHou","NanyunPeng","DakuoWang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4463","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77023/poster_document/d232ff662ac5f24a45557112cb6dfabe.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Are Fairy Tales Fair?

An alternative to subword tokenizers is byte-based tokenization, i.e., tokenization into byte sequences using the UTF-8 encoding scheme. Byte tokens often represent inputs at a sub-character granularity, i.e., one character can be represented by a span of byte tokens.

We propose to address this problem by using large language models to generate adversarial examples to enhance training, which significantly improves the robustness of Table QA models.","authors":["YilunZhao","ChenZhao","LinyongNan","ZhentingQi","WenlinZhang","XiangruTang","BoyuMi","DragomirRadev"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-question-answering-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P451","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"RobuT: A Systematic Study of Table QA Robustness Against Human-Annotated Adversarial Perturbations","tldr":"Despite significant progress having been made in question answering on tabular data (Table QA), it's unclear whether, and to what extent existing Table QA models are robust to task-specific perturbati...","track":"Question Answering","underline_id":76422,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76422-robut-a-systematic-study-of-table-qa-robustness-against-human-annotated-adversarial-perturbations","video_url":null},{"abstract":"In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new tasks by prompting them with a sequence of training examples.

To avoid this, we introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task instructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an underlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to include instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces an encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during decoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\\% when controlling for compute (measured in FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively disregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of compute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25\\% by incorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5\\% more compute.

Using literalness measures involving word alignment and monotonicity, we find that translations out of English (E-X) from GPTs tend to be less literal, while exhibiting similar or better scores on MT quality metrics. We demonstrate that this finding is borne out in human evaluations as well.

However, existing studies either optimize the retriever and reranker in independent ways, or distill the knowledge from a pre-trained reranker into the retriever in an asynchronous way, leading to sub-optimal performance of both modules. Thus, an open question remains about how to train them for a better combination of the best of both worlds.

Here, we demonstrate that the original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and propose an adapted metric, in which we mask not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target. We show that our adapted metric (PLL-word-l2r) outperforms both the original PLL metric and a PLL metric in which all within-word tokens are masked. In particular, it better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models. Finally, we show that the choice of metric affects even tightly controlled, minimal pair evaluation benchmarks (such as BLiMP), underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM properties.","authors":["CarinaKauf","AnnaIvanova"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-resources-and-evaluation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4593","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77053/poster_document/667de449d4adf0346cce2d6bd8d145b2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A Better Way to Do Masked Language Model Scoring","tldr":"Estimating the log-likelihood of a given sentence under an autoregressive language model is straightforward: one can simply apply the chain rule and sum the log-likelihood values for each successive t...","track":"Resources and Evaluation","underline_id":77053,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77053-a-better-way-to-do-masked-language-model-scoring","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Neural QCFG is a grammar-based sequence-to-sequence model with strong inductive biases on hierarchical structures.

However, rationalization suffers from two key challenges, i.e., spurious correlation and degeneration, where the predictor overfits the spurious or meaningless pieces solely selected by the not-yet well-trained generator and in turn deteriorates the generator. Although many studies have been proposed to address the two challenges, they are usually designed separately and do not take both of them into account. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method named MGR to simultaneously solve the two problems. The key idea of MGR is to employ multiple generators such that the occurrence stability of real pieces is improved and more meaningful pieces are delivered to the predictor. Empirically, we show that MGR improves the F1 score by up to 20.9\\% as compared to state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["WeiLiu","HaozhaoWang","JunWang","RuixuanLi","XinyangLi","YuanKaiZhang","YangQiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P4690","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76334/poster_document/612b7c8e8805dbe04615d9987d9b33fa.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"MGR: Multi-generator Based Rationalization","tldr":"Rationalization is to employ a generator and a predictor to construct a self-explaining NLP model in which the generator selects a subset of human-intelligible pieces of the input text to the followin...","track":"Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP","underline_id":76334,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76334-mgr-multi-generator-based-rationalization","video_url":null},{"abstract":"We make decisions by reacting to changes in the real world, particularly the emergence and disappearance of impermanent entities such as restaurants, services, and events. \nBecause we want to avoid missing out on opportunities or making fruitless actions after those entities have disappeared, it is important to know when entities disappear as early as possible.\nWe thus tackle the task of detecting disappearing entities from microblogs where various information is shared timely.\nThe major challenge is detecting uncertain contexts of disappearing entities from noisy microblog posts.\nTo collect such disappearing contexts, we design time-sensitive distant supervision, which utilizes entities from the knowledge base and time-series posts.\nUsing this method, we actually build large-scale Twitter datasets of disappearing entities.\nTo ensure robust detection in noisy environments, we refine pretrained word embeddings for the detection model on microblog streams in a timely manner.\nExperimental results on the Twitter datasets confirmed \nthe effectiveness of the collected labeled data and refined word embeddings; the proposed method outperformed a baseline in terms of accuracy, and more than 70\\% of the detected disappearing entities in Wikipedia are discovered earlier than the update on Wikipedia, with the average lead-time is over one month.","authors":["SatoshiAkasaki","NaokiYoshinaga","MasashiToyoda"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-information-extraction-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4691","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77062/poster_document/8a7bea7ce9d24a824b3e0e7e35ccc47e.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Early Discovery of Disappearing Entities in Microblogs","tldr":"We make decisions by reacting to changes in the real world, particularly the emergence and disappearance of impermanent entities such as restaurants, services, and events. \nBecause we want to avoid mi...","track":"Information Extraction","underline_id":77062,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77062-early-discovery-of-disappearing-entities-in-microblogs","video_url":null},{"abstract":"With the advent of pre-trained language models (LMs), increasing research efforts have been focusing on infusing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge to prepare LMs for downstream tasks. These works attempt to leverage knowledge graphs, the de facto standard of symbolic knowledge representation, along with pre-trained LMs. While existing approaches leverage external knowledge, it remains an open question how to jointly incorporate knowledge graphs represented in varying contexts --- from local (e.g., sentence), document-level, to global knowledge, to enable knowledge-rich and interpretable exchange across contexts. In addition, incorporating varying contexts can especially benefit long document understanding tasks that leverage pre-trained LMs, typically bounded by the input sequence length. In light of these challenges, we propose KALM, a language model that jointly leverages knowledge in local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding. KALM firstly encodes long documents and knowledge graphs into the three knowledge-aware context representations. KALM then processes each context with context-specific layers. These context-specific layers are followed by a ContextFusion layer that facilitates knowledge exchange to derive an overarching document representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three long document understanding tasks across 6 datasets/settings. Further analyses reveal that the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to model performance, while the importance and information exchange patterns of different contexts vary on different tasks and datasets.","authors":["ShangbinFeng","ZhaoxuanTan","WenqianZhang","ZhenyuLei","YuliaTsvetkov"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4694","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77063/poster_document/5233dcb9183e5bbc8ec0a88f46217255.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"KALM: Knowledge-Aware Integration of Local, Document, and Global Contexts for Long Document Understanding","tldr":"With the advent of pre-trained language models (LMs), increasing research efforts have been focusing on infusing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge to prepare LMs for downstream tasks.

To mitigate this opacity, this work presents a linear decomposition of final hidden states from autoregressive language models based on each initial input token, which is exact for virtually all contemporary Transformer architectures. This decomposition allows the definition of probability distributions that ablate the contribution of specific input tokens, which can be used to analyze their influence on model probabilities over a sequence of upcoming words with only one forward pass from the model. Using the change in next-word probability as a measure of importance, this work first examines which context words make the biggest contribution to language model predictions. Regression experiments suggest that Transformer-based language models rely primarily on collocational associations, followed by linguistic factors such as syntactic dependencies and coreference relationships in making next-word predictions. Additionally, analyses using these measures to predict syntactic dependencies and coreferent mention spans show that collocational association and repetitions of the same token largely explain the language models' predictions on these tasks.","authors":["Byung-DohOh","WilliamSchuler"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4763","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77069/poster_document/e7965e013c449c555ac95561aaa9ef97.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Token-wise Decomposition of Autoregressive Language Model Hidden States for Analyzing Model Predictions","tldr":"While there is much recent interest in studying why Transformer-based large language models make predictions the way they do, the complex computations performed within each layer have made their behav...","track":"Large Language Models","underline_id":77069,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77069-token-wise-decomposition-of-autoregressive-language-model-hidden-states-for-analyzing-model-predictions","video_url":null},{"abstract":"This paper presents a whitening-based contrastive learning method for sentence embedding learning (WhitenedCSE), which combines contrastive learning with a novel shuffled group whitening. Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the \"pushing'' operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group.

However, the existing QA models always rely on shortcuts, e.g., providing the true answer by only one fact, rather than multi-hop reasoning, which is referred as disconnected reasoning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel counterfactual multihop QA, a causal-effect approach that enables to reduce the disconnected reasoning. It builds upon explicitly modeling of causality: 1) the direct causal effects of disconnected reasoning and 2) the causal effect of true multi-hop reasoning from the total causal effect. With the causal graph,  a counterfactual inference is proposed  to disentangle the disconnected reasoning from the total causal effect, which provides us a new perspective and technology to learn a QA model that exploits the true multi-hop reasoning instead of shortcuts. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the benchmark HotpotQA dataset, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve notable improvement on reducing disconnected reasoning. For example, our method achieves 5.8\\% higher points of its Supps score on HotpotQA through true multihop reasoning.

Prior work has studied targeted updates to LMs, injecting individual facts and evaluating whether the model learns these facts while not changing predictions on other contexts. We take a step forward and study LMs' abilities to make inferences based on injected facts (or propagate those facts): for example, after learning that something is a TV show, does an LM predict that you can watch it? We study this with two cloze-style tasks: an existing dataset of real-world sentences about novel entities (ECBD) as well as a new controlled benchmark with manually designed templates requiring varying levels of inference about injected knowledge. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods for updating knowledge (gradient-based fine-tuning and modifications of this approach) show little propagation of injected knowledge. These methods improve performance on cloze instances only when there is lexical overlap between injected facts and target inferences. Yet, prepending entity definitions in an LM's context improves performance across all settings, suggesting that there is substantial headroom for parameter-updating approaches for knowledge injection.","authors":["YasumasaOnoe","MichaelJ.Q.Zhang","ShankarPadmanabhan","GregDurrett","EunsolChoi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-5_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4792","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77071/poster_document/0f102fc08fc5fde747ac5b321a508f88.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Can LMs Learn New Entities from Descriptions?

We propose a hierarchical duality learning for dialogue (HDLD) to simulate this human cognitive ability, for generating high quality responses that connect both previous and follow-up dialogues. HDLD utilizes hierarchical dualities at token hierarchy and utterance hierarchy. HDLD maximizes the mutual information between past and future utterances. Thus, even if future text is invisible during inference, HDLD is capable of estimating future information implicitly based on dialogue history and generates both coherent and informative responses. In contrast to previous approaches that solely utilize future text as auxiliary information to encode during training, HDLD leverages duality to enable interaction between dialogue history and the future.

However, such models can fail to produce output faithful to the input data, particularly on out-of-domain data. Sufficient annotated data is often not available for specific domains, leading us to seek an unsupervised approach to improve the faithfulness of output text. Since the problem is fundamentally one of consistency between the representations of the structured data and text, we evaluate the effectiveness of cycle training in this work. Cycle training uses two models which are inverses of each other: one that generates text from structured data, and one which generates the structured data from natural language text. We show that cycle training, when initialized with a small amount of supervised data (100 samples in our case), achieves nearly the same performance as fully supervised approaches for the data-to-text generation task on the WebNLG, E2E, WTQ, and WSQL datasets. We perform extensive empirical analysis with automated evaluation metrics and a newly designed human evaluation schema to reveal different cycle training strategies' effectiveness of reducing various types of generation errors.\nOur code is publicly available at https://github.com/Edillower/CycleNLG.","authors":["ZhuoerWang","MarcusCollins","NikhitaVedula","SimoneFilice","ShervinMalmasi","OlegRokhlenko"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-generation-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4865","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77080/poster_document/c0b850e74089362d152da553c48d04c2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Faithful Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation through Cycle Training","tldr":"Methods to generate text from structured data have advanced significantly in recent years, primarily due to fine-tuning of pre-trained language models on large datasets.

NLU models should thus account for such ambiguity, but they approximate the human opinion distributions quite poorly and tend to produce over-confident predictions. To address this problem, we must consider how to exactly capture the degree of relationship between each sample and its candidate classes. In this work, we propose a novel method with deep model compression and show how such relationship can be accounted for. We see that more reasonably represented relationships can be discovered in the lower layers and that validation accuracies are converging at these layers, which naturally leads to layer pruning. We also see that distilling the relationship knowledge from a lower layer helps models produce better distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method makes substantial improvement on quantifying ambiguity without gold distribution labels.

In this paper, we explore intent-conditioned counterspeech generation. At first, we develop IntentCONAN, a diversified intent-specific counterspeech dataset with 6831 counterspeeches conditioned on five intents, i.e., informative, denouncing, question, positive, and humour. Subsequently, we propose QUARC, a two-stage framework for intent-conditioned counterspeech generation. QUARC leverages vector-quantized representations learned for each intent category along with PerFuMe, a novel fusion module to incorporate intent-specific information into the model.

To achieve the best performance for NLP tasks with just a few samples, it is vital to include as many informative samples as possible and to avoid misleading ones. However, there is no work in prompt-tuning literature addressing the problem of differentiating informative hard samples from misleading ones in model training, which is challenging due to the lack of supervision signals about the quality of the samples to train a well-performed model. We propose a Hard Sample Aware Prompt-Tuning framework (i.e. HardPT) to solve the non-differentiable problem in hard sample identification with reinforcement learning, and to strengthen the discrimination of the feature space without changing the original data distribution via an adaptive contrastive learning method. An extensive empirical study on a series of NLP tasks demonstrates the capability of HardPT in few-shot scenarios.

For example, toxicity detection in user-generated content is a subjective task, and notions of toxicity can be annotated according to a variety of definitions that can be in conflict with one another. Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that state-of-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty estimation method that combines epistemic and aleatoric UE methods. We show that by using our hybrid method, we can outperform state-of-the-art UE methods for toxicity detection and other ambiguous text classification tasks.","authors":["ArtemVazhentsev","GlebKuzmin","AkimTsvigun","AlexanderPanchenko","MaximPanov","MikhailBurtsev","ArtemShelmanov"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5065","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77104/poster_document/5d7a720e9a6b2111c7b29f7e34f1b8c2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Selective Text Classification in Ambiguous Tasks","tldr":"Many text classification tasks are inherently ambiguous, which results in automatic systems having a high risk of making mistakes, in spite of using advanced machine learning models.

PuMer learns to keep salient image tokens related to the input text and merges similar textual and visual tokens by adding lightweight token reducer modules at several cross-modal layers in the VL model. Training PuMer is mostly the same as finetuning the original VL model but faster. Our evaluation for two vision language models on four downstream VL tasks shows PuMer increases inference throughput by up to 2x and reduces memory footprint by over 50\\% while incurring less than a 1\\% accuracy drop.","authors":["QingqingCao","BhargaviParanjape","HannanehHajishirzi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P514","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76434/poster_document/a88393416c62229f3cfd09fdeb86bd3c.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"PuMer: Pruning and Merging Tokens for Efficient Vision Language Models","tldr":"Large-scale vision language (VL) models use Transformers to perform cross-modal interactions between the input text and image.

Our model thus directly operates on character sequences with explicit awareness of word boundaries, but without biased sub-word or word-level vocabulary.

This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks.

This effectively violates the main assumptions of \u2018true' ZS-XLT and FS-XLT. Such XLT setups require robust methods that do not depend on labeled target language data for validation and model selection. In this work, aiming to improve the robustness of \u2018true' ZS-XLT and FS-XLT, we propose a simple and effective method that averages different checkpoints (i.e., model snapshots) during task fine-tuning. We conduct exhaustive ZS-XLT and FS-XLT experiments across higher-level semantic tasks (NLI, extractive QA) and lower-level token classification tasks (NER, POS). The results indicate that averaging model checkpoints yields systematic and consistent performance gains across diverse target languages in all tasks. Importantly, it simultaneously substantially desensitizes XLT to varying hyperparameter choices in the absence of target language validation.

However, for the persona-based dialogue generation task, consistency and coherence are also key factors, which are great challenges for language models. Existing works mainly focus on valuable data filtering, model structure modifying, or objective function designing, while their improvements are limited and hard to generalize to all types of pre-trained language models. However, we find that language models can produce consistent and coherent responses if we consider enough generations. Thus, the problems lay in large-scale response generation and target response selection. In this work, a simple but effective two-stage SimOAP strategy is proposed, i.e., over-sampling and post-evaluation. The over-sampling stage takes large-scale responses from existing trained models efficiently via off-the-shelf distilling and compressing methods, and the post-evaluation stage selects a good response based on multiple well-designed evaluation metrics from large-scale candidates. Experimental results show that the proposed plug-in SimOAP strategy improves the backbone models and outperforms the baseline strategies in both automatic and human evaluations.","authors":["JunkaiZhou","LiangPang","HuaweiShen","XueqiCheng"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5254","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77119/poster_document/928883f2d637eabbd17a8b8d830d67a1.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"SimOAP: Improve Coherence and Consistency in Persona-based Dialogue Generation via Over-sampling and Post-evaluation","tldr":"Language models trained on large-scale corpora can generate remarkably fluent results in open-domain dialogue.

Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely used in text-based concept extraction (CE). However, PLMs tend to mine the co-occurrence associations from massive corpus as pre-trained knowledge rather than the real causal effect between tokens. As a result, the pre-trained knowledge confounds PLMs to extract biased concepts based on spurious co-occurrence correlations, inevitably resulting in low precision. In this paper, through the lens of a Structural Causal Model (SCM), we propose equipping the PLM-based extractor with a knowledge-guided prompt as an intervention to alleviate concept bias. The prompt adopts the topic of the given entity from the existing knowledge in KGs to mitigate the spurious co-occurrence correlations between entities and biased concepts. Our extensive experiments on representative multilingual KG datasets justify that our proposed prompt can effectively alleviate concept bias and improve the performance of PLM-based CE models.","authors":["SiyuYuan","DeqingYang","JinxiLiu","ShuyuTian","JiaqingLiang","YanghuaXiao","RuiXie"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-information-extraction-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P526","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76438/poster_document/8a58f60c7abd8fb333d95980d63d3a3e.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Causality-aware Concept Extraction based on Knowledge-guided Prompting","tldr":"Concepts benefit natural language understanding but are far from complete in existing knowledge graphs (KGs).

Discourse markers are natural representations of discourse in our daily language. One challenge is that the markers as well as pre-defined and human-labeled discourse relations can be ambiguous when describing the semantics between sentences. We believe that a better approach is to use a contextual-dependent distribution over the markers to express discourse information. In this work, we propose to learn a Distributed Marker Representation (DMR) by utilizing the (potentially) unlimited discourse marker data with a latent discourse sense, thereby bridging markers with sentence pairs. Such representations can be learned automatically from data without supervision, and in turn provide insights into the data itself. Experiments show the SOTA performance of our DMR on the implicit discourse relation recognition task and strong interpretability. Our method also offers a valuable tool to understand complex ambiguity and entanglement among discourse markers and manually defined discourse relations.","authors":["DongyuRu","LinQiu","XipengQiu","YueZhang","ZhengZhang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-discourse-and-pragmatics-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5261","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77120/poster_document/50790181af53ff197c44407ee0af7022.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Distributed Marker Representation for Ambiguous Discourse Markers and Entangled Relations","tldr":"Discourse analysis is an important task because it models intrinsic semantic structures between sentences in a document.

To address these challenges, we propose CONE, an efficient  COarse-to-fiNE alignment framework. CONE is a plug-and-play framework on top of existing VTG models to handle long videos through a sliding window mechanism. Specifically, CONE (1) introduces a query-guided window selection strategy to speed up inference, and (2) proposes a coarse-to-fine mechanism via a novel incorporation of contrastive learning to enhance multi-modal alignment for long videos. Extensive experiments on two large-scale long VTG benchmarks consistently show both substantial performance gains (e.g., from 3.13 to 6.87\\% on MAD) and state-of-the-art results. Analyses also reveal higher efficiency as the query-guided window selection mechanism accelerates inference time by 2x on Ego4D-NLQ and 15x on MAD while keeping SOTA results.

To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we propose a bilingual RE model that leverages both Korean and Hanja contexts to predict relations between entities. Our model outperforms monolingual baselines on HistRED, showing that employing multiple language contexts supplements the RE predictions.

We adapt Weir's definition of a controllable CFG (called a labeled distinguished CFG) to give a definition of controllable pushdown automata (PDAs), called labeled distinguished PDAs. This yields three new characterizations of L2 as the class of languages generated by PDAs controlling PDAs, PDAs controlling CFGs, and CFGs controlling PDAs. We show that these four formalisms are not only weakly equivalent but equivalent in a stricter sense that we call d-weak equivalence. Furthermore, using an even stricter notion of equivalence called d-strong equivalence, we make precise the intuition that a CFG controlling a CFG is a TAG, a PDA controlling a PDA is an embedded PDA, and a PDA controlling a CFG is a LIG. The fourth member of this family, a CFG controlling a PDA, does not correspond to any kind of automaton we know of, so we invent one and call it a Pushdown Adjoining Automaton (PAA).","authors":["AlexandraCristinaButoi","RyanCotterell","DavidChiang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-syntax_-tagging,-chunking,-and-parsing-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5362","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Convergence and Diversity in the Control Hierarchy","tldr":"Weir has defined a hierarchy of language classes whose second member (L2) is generated by tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), linear indexed grammars (LIG), combinatory categorial grammars, and head gramma...","track":"Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing","underline_id":77128,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77128-convergence-and-diversity-in-the-control-hierarchy","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Reasoning about time is of fundamental importance.

Despite the recent success, current S2ST models still suffer from distinct degradation in noisy environments and fail to translate visual speech (i.e., the movement of lips and teeth). In this work, we present AV-TranSpeech, the first audio-visual speech-to-speech (AV-S2ST) translation model without relying on intermediate text. AV-TranSpeech complements the audio stream with visual information to promote system robustness and opens up a host of practical applications: dictation or dubbing archival films. To mitigate the data scarcity with limited parallel AV-S2ST data, we 1) explore self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled audio-visual data to learn contextual representation, and 2) introduce cross-modal distillation with S2ST models trained on the audio-only corpus to further reduce the requirements of visual data. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate that AV-TranSpeech outperforms audio-only models under all settings regardless of the type of noise. With low-resource audio-visual data (10h, 30h), cross-modal distillation yields an improvement of 7.6 BLEU on average compared with baselines.{Audio samples are available at https://AV-TranSpeech.github.io/.","authors":["RongjieHuang","HuadaiLiu","XizeCheng","YiRen","LinjunLi","ZhenhuiYe","JinzhengHe","LichaoZhang","JinglinLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-speech-and-multimodality-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P555","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"AV-TranSpeech: Audio-Visual Robust Speech-to-Speech Translation","tldr":"Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert speech from one language into another, and has demonstrated significant progress to date.

However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.","authors":["AmirhosseinAbaskohi","SaschaRothe","YadollahYaghoobzadeh"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5561","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77135/poster_document/321caab2a861a05942ed5f3e2d007bf8.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"LM-CPPF: Paraphrasing-Guided Data Augmentation for Contrastive Prompt-Based Few-Shot Fine-Tuning","tldr":"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing pre-trained language models for NLP.

In this work, we argue fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity level.

Extensive experiments at various sparsity levels show SMP has significant improvements over first-order and zero-order methods.

This paper proposes a Bayesian approach, deep evidential emotion regression (DEER), to estimate the uncertainty in emotion attributes. Treating the emotion attribute labels of an utterance as samples drawn from an unknown Gaussian distribution, DEER places an utterance-specific normal-inverse gamma prior over the Gaussian likelihood and predicts its hyper-parameters using a deep neural network model.

The former generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for the later, which contributes to more robust representations and correctly separated clusters. To provide robustness against the imbalance in data, we propose self-adaptive optimal transport in the pseudo-label generation module. To improve robustness against the noise in data, we further introduce both class-wise and instance-wise contrastive learning in the robust representation learning module.

Recent work has aimed to provide textual summaries in the form of concise and salient short texts, i.e., key points (KPs), in a task known as  Key Point Analysis (KPA).  One of the main challenges in KPA is finding high-quality key point candidates from dozens of arguments even in a small corpus.   Furthermore, evaluating key points is crucial in ensuring that the automatically generated summaries are useful.  Although automatic methods for evaluating summarisation have considerably advanced over the years, they mainly focus on sentence-level comparison, making it difficult to measure the quality of a summary (a set of KPs) as a whole. Aggravating this problem is the fact that human evaluation is costly and unreproducible.  To address the above issues, we propose a two-step abstractive summarisation framework based on neural topic modelling with an iterative clustering procedure, to generate key points which are aligned with how humans identify key points. Our experiments show that our framework advances the state of the art in KPA, with performance improvement of up to 14 (absolute) percentage points, in terms of both ROUGE and our own proposed evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated summaries using a novel set-based evaluation toolkit. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics in assessing the quality of generated KPs. Human evaluation further demonstrates the advantages of our approach and validates that our proposed evaluation metric is more consistent with human judgment than ROUGE scores.","authors":["HaoLi","ViktorSchlegel","RizaBatista-Navarro","GoranNenadic"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5576","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77143/poster_document/cf1cad8596e030f4e3e4ee766b5f77e4.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Do You Hear The People Sing?

Recent works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks.","authors":["AlexanderScarlatos","AndrewLan"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5580","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77146/poster_document/719650bf000d54286d8551aaac6eb145.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Tree-Based Representation and Generation of Natural and Mathematical Language","tldr":"Mathematical language in scientific communications and educational scenarios is important yet relatively understudied compared to natural languages.

Concretely, our randomized positional encoding scheme simulates the positions of longer sequences and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the sequence's length.

A model able to produce accurate and reliable supporting evidence for each code would be a tremendous benefit. However, a human annotated code evidence corpus is extremely difficult to create because it requires specialized knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MDACE, the first publicly available code evidence dataset, which is built on a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical records.

We implemented several evidence extraction methods based on the EffectiveCAN model (Liu et al., 2021) to establish baseline performance on this dataset. MDACE can be used to evaluate code evidence extraction methods for CAC systems, as well as the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models for multi-label classification.

We thoroughly explore the influence of paraphrasers, and dynamics between paraphrasing strength and gold dataset size on the NER performance with visualizations and statistical testing. We find that the choice of the paraphraser greatly impacts NER performance, with one of the larger GPT-3 variants exceedingly capable of generating high quality paraphrases, yielding statistically significant improvements in NER performance with increasing paraphrasing strength, while other paraphrasers show more mixed results. Additionally, inline auto annotations generated by larger GPT-3 are strictly better than heuristic based annotations. We also find diminishing benefits of paraphrasing as gold annotations increase for most datasets. Furthermore, while most paraphrasers promote entity memorization in NER, the proposed GPT-3 configuration performs most favorably among the compared paraphrasers when tested on unseen entities, with memorization reducing further with paraphrasing strength.

Although existing commonsense question answering works based on fully fine-tuned PLMs have achieved promising results, they suffer from prohibitive computation costs as well as poor interpretability. Some works improve the PLMs by incorporating knowledge to provide certain evidence, via elaborately designed GNN modules which require expertise. In this paper, we propose a simple knowledgeable parameter efficient tuning network to couple PLMs with external knowledge  for commonsense question answering. Specifically, we design a trainable parameter-sharing adapter attached to a parameter-freezing PLM to incorporate knowledge at a small cost.

However, these models also suffer from the pathology of overconfidence in the out-of-distribution examples, potentially making the model difficult to interpret and making the interpretation methods fail to provide faithful attributions. In this paper, we explain the model pathology from the view of sentence representation and argue that the counter-intuitive bias degree and direction of the out-of-distribution examples' representation cause the pathology. We propose a Contrastive learning regularization method using Adversarial examples for Alleviating the Pathology (ConAAP), which calibrates the sentence representation of out-of-distribution examples. ConAAP generates positive and negative examples following the attribution results and utilizes adversarial examples to introduce direction information in regularization. Experiments show that ConAAP effectively alleviates the model pathology while slightly impacting the generalization ability on in-distribution examples and thus helps interpretation methods obtain more faithful results.","authors":["PengweiZhan","JingYang","XiaoHuang","ChunleiJing","JingyingLi","LimingWang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5617","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77161/poster_document/5407e2b2cbe32eb62b5f20582cd7f092.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Examples for Alleviating Pathology of Language Model","tldr":"Neural language models have achieved superior performance.

However, two pain points persist for this paradigm: (a) as the pre-trained models grow bigger (e.g., 175B parameters for GPT-3), even the fine-tuning process can be time-consuming and computationally expensive; (b) the fine-tuned model has the same size as its starting point by default, which is neither sensible due to its more specialized functionality, nor practical since many fine-tuned models will be deployed in resource-constrained environments. To address these pain points, we propose a framework for resource- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning by leveraging the sparsity prior in both weight updates and the final model weights. Our proposed framework, dubbed Dually Sparsity-Embedded Efficient Tuning (DSEE), aims to achieve two key objectives: (i) parameter efficient fine-tuning -  by enforcing sparsity-aware low-rank updates on top of the pre-trained weights; and (ii) resource-efficient inference - by encouraging a sparse weight structure towards the final fine-tuned model. We leverage sparsity in these two directions by exploiting both unstructured and structured sparse patterns in pre-trained language models via\na unified approach. Extensive experiments and in-depth investigations, with diverse network backbones (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets, consistently demonstrate impressive parameter-/inference-efficiency, while maintaining competitive downstream performance.

The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality,  the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct, a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated conversation from a context. Compared with the existing answer-unaware CQG models, the proposed SG-CQG achieves state-of-the-art performance.","authors":["Xuan LongDo","BoweiZou","ShafiqJoty","TranAnhTai","LiangmingPan","NancyChen","Ai TiAw"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5623","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Modeling What-to-ask and How-to-ask for Answer-unaware Conversational Question Generation","tldr":"Conversational Question Generation (CQG) is a critical task for machines to assist humans in fulfilling their information needs through conversations.

With recent transformer-based language models (LMs), reasoning over text is desirable and seemingly feasible, leading to the question of whether LMs can effectively and efficiently learn to solve RAC problems. We propose four essential RAC tasks as a comprehensive textual benchmark and generate problems in a way that minimizes the influence of other linguistic requirements (e.g., grounding) to focus on RAC. The resulting benchmark, TRAC, encompassing problems of various complexities, facilitates a more granular evaluation of LMs, precisely targeting the structural generalization ability much needed for RAC.

This unclarity has implications on issues of trust, interpretability and factuality. In this work, we propose a new paradigm in which QA models are trained to disentangle the two sources of knowledge. Using counterfactual data augmentation, we introduce a model that predicts two answers for a given question: one based on given contextual knowledge and one based on parametric knowledge. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset show that this approach improves the performance of QA models by making them more robust to knowledge conflicts between the two knowledge sources, while generating useful disentangled answers.","authors":["EllaNeeman","RoeeAharoni","OrHonovich","LeshemChoshen","IdanSzpektor","OmriAbend"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-question-answering-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5643","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77174/poster_document/842217e400bdc9342d3fca229a0b2fa0.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DisentQA: Disentangling Parametric and Contextual Knowledge with Counterfactual Question Answering","tldr":"Question answering models commonly have access to two sources of \"knowledge\" during inference time: (1) parametric knowledge - the factual knowledge encoded in the model weights, and (2) contextual kn...","track":"Question Answering","underline_id":77174,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77174-disentqa-disentangling-parametric-and-contextual-knowledge-with-counterfactual-question-answering","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Natural language processing (NLP) researchers develop models of grammar, meaning and communication based on written text.

However, the result of existing methods is still far from satisfactory. Previous works indicated that omission is a major factor in affecting the quality of summarization, but few of them have further explored the omission problem, such as how omission affects summarization results and how to detect omission, which is critical for reducing omission and improving summarization quality. Moreover, analyzing and detecting omission relies on summarization datasets with omission labels (i.e., which dialogue utterances are omitted in the summarization), which are not available in the current literature. In this paper, we propose the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. By analyzing this dataset, we find that a large improvement in summarization quality can be achieved by providing ground-truth omission labels for the summarization model to recover omission information, which demonstrates the importance of omission detection for omission mitigation in dialogue summarization. Therefore, we formulate an omission detection task and demonstrate our proposed dataset can support the training and evaluation of this task well. We also call for research action on omission detection based on our proposed datasets.

Second, the number of events in documents must be specified in advance. Last, unexpected errors usually exist when decoding events based on the entity-entity adjacency matrix. To address these issues, this paper designs a Token-Token Bidirectional Event Completed Graph (TT-BECG) in which the relation eType-Role1-Role2 serves as the edge type, precisely revealing which tokens play argument roles in an event of a specific event type. Exploiting the token-token adjacency matrix of the TT-BECG, we develop an edge-enhanced joint document-level event extraction model. Guided by the target token-token adjacency matrix, the predicted token-token adjacency matrix can be obtained during the model training. Then, extracted events and event records in a document are decoded based on the predicted matrix, including the graph structure and edge type decoding.

In this work, we propose sequence parallelism, a memory-efficient parallelism to solve this issue from system perspective instead. Our approach is compatible with most existing parallelisms (e.g., data, pipeline, and tensor parallelism), which means our sequence parallelism makes 4D parallelism possible. More importantly, we no longer require a single device to hold the whole sequence. Besides, using efficient attention with linear complexity, our sequence parallelism enables us to train transformer with infinite long sequence. Specifically, we split the input sequence into multiple chunks and feed each chunk into its corresponding device (i.e., GPU). To compute the attention output, we integrated ring-style communication with self-attention calculation and proposed Ring Self-Attention (RSA). Experiments show that sequence parallelism performs well when scaling with batch size and sequence length. Compared with tensor parallelism, our approach achieved $13.7\\times$ and $3.0\\times$ maximum batch size and sequence length respectively when scaling up to 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

Consequently, illegal markets and their connections are challenging to uncover on the Darknet. To identify relationships between illegal markets and their vendors, we propose VendorLink, an NLP-based approach that examines writing patterns to verify, identify, and link unique vendor accounts across text advertisements (ads) on seven public Darknet markets. In contrast to existing literature, VendorLink utilizes the strength of supervised pre-training to perform closed-set vendor verification, open-set vendor identification, and low-resource market adaption tasks. Through VendorLink, we uncover (i) 15 migrants and 71 potential aliases in the Alphabay-Dreams-Silk dataset, (ii) 17 migrants and 3 potential aliases in the Valhalla-Berlusconi dataset, and (iii) 75 migrants and 10 potential aliases in the Traderoute-Agora dataset.

In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector i.e., single-attribute prompt), which guides the generation of a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to satisfy a pre-specified attribute. These prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole for multi-attribute CTG without any re-training. Nevertheless, this may raise problems of fluency downgrading and position sensitivity. To solve this, Tailor provides two solutions to enhance the combination. The former contains a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one single-attribute prompt for each task) and the testing stage (concatenating two prompts). The latter introduces a trainable prompt connector to further enhance the combinations.

Specifically, a novel Peer Data Augmentation (PeerDA) approach is proposed which employs span pairs with the PR relation as the augmentation data for training. PeerDA has two unique advantages: (1) There are a large number of PR span pairs for augmenting the training data. (2) The augmented data can prevent the trained model from over-fitting the superficial span-category mapping by pushing the model to leverage the span semantics. Experimental results on ten datasets over four diverse tasks across seven domains demonstrate the effectiveness of PeerDA.

Research efforts have been made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency. Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social media, BIC employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further analyses reveal that text-graph interactions and modeling semantic consistency are essential improvements and help combat bot evolution.","authors":["ZhenyuLei","HerunWan","WenqianZhang","ShangbinFeng","ZilongChen","JundongLi","QinghuaZheng","MinnanLuo"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-2_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5713","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77205/poster_document/38c1e5a441d4d345edaa0b359dc6fb24.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"BIC: Twitter Bot Detection with Text-Graph Interaction and Semantic Consistency","tldr":"Twitter bots are automatic programs operated by malicious actors to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation.

Thus, it is crucial to test model performance on data with realistic input noises to ensure robustness and fairness. However, little study has been done to construct such benchmarks for Chinese, where various language-specific input noises happen in the real world. In order to fill this important gap, we construct READIN: a Chinese multi-task benchmark with REalistic And Diverse Input Noises. READIN contains four diverse tasks and requests annotators to re-enter the original test data with two commonly used Chinese input methods: Pinyin input and speech input. We designed our annotation pipeline to maximize diversity, for example by instructing the annotators to use diverse input method editors (IMEs) for keyboard noises and recruiting speakers from diverse dialectical groups for speech noises. We experiment with a series of strong pretrained language models as well as robust training methods, we find that these models often suffer significant performance drops on READIN even with robustness methods like data augmentation. As the first large-scale attempt in creating a benchmark with noises geared towards user-generated inputs, we believe that READIN serves as an important complement to existing Chinese NLP benchmarks.

Instead of using direct supervision, this work proposes an approach for abductive commonsense reasoning that exploits the fact that only a subset of explanations is correct for a given context. The method uses posterior regularization to enforce a mutual exclusion constraint, encouraging the model to learn the distinction between fluent explanations and plausible ones.

In this paper, we present a training method to reduce the reliance of NLI models on shortcuts and improve their out-of-distribution performance without assuming prior knowledge of the shortcuts being targeted. To this end, we propose a minimax objective between a learner model being trained for the NLI task, and an auxiliary model aiming to maximize the learner's loss by up-weighting examples from regions of the input space where the learner incurs high losses. This process incentivizes the learner to focus on under-represented \"hard\" examples with patterns that contradict the shortcuts learned from the prevailing \"easy\" examples.

However, they tend to be brittle as slight edits to a prompt could lead to very different generations; these robustness properties, critical for user experience when deployed in real-life applications, are not well understood. Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in code generation. In this paper, we propose ReCode, a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark for code generation models. We customize over 30 transformations specifically for code on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format. They are carefully designed to be natural in real-life coding practice, preserve the original semantic meaning, and thus provide multifaceted assessments of a model's robustness performance. With human annotators, we verified that over 90\\% of the perturbed prompts do not alter the semantic meaning of the original prompt. In addition, we define robustness metrics for code generation models considering the worst-case behavior under each type of perturbation, taking advantage of the fact that executing the generated code can serve as objective evaluation. We demonstrate ReCode on SOTA models using HumanEval, MBPP, as well as function completion tasks derived from them. Interesting observations include: better robustness for CodeGen over InCoder and GPT-J; models are most sensitive to syntax perturbations; more challenging robustness evaluation on MBPP over HumanEval.","authors":["ShiqiWang","ZhengLi","HaifengQian","ChenghaoYang","ZijianWang","MingyueShang","VarunKumar","SamsonTan","BaishakhiRay","ParminderBhatia","RameshNallapati","Murali KrishnaRamanathan","DanRoth","BingXiang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5744","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77215/poster_document/de04f1513f8c90d83c2fde93fa9dde1f.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"ReCode: Robustness Evaluation of Code Generation Models","tldr":"Code generation models have achieved impressive performance.

However, the ever-evolving nature of summarization systems, metrics, and annotated benchmarks makes factuality evaluation a moving target, and drawing clear comparisons among metrics has become increasingly difficult. In this work, we aggregate factuality error annotations from nine existing datasets and stratify them according to the underlying summarization model. We compare performance of state-of-the-art factuality metrics, including recent ChatGPT-based metrics, on this stratified benchmark and show that their performance varies significantly across different types of summarization models.

By taking the model's prediction as the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, self-training bootstraps the model with pseudo instances in the target domain. However, the prediction errors of pseudo labels (label noise) challenge the performance of self-training. To address this problem, previous approaches only use reliable pseudo instances, i.e., pseudo instances with high prediction confidence, to retrain the model. Although these strategies effectively reduce the label noise, they are prone to miss the hard examples. In this paper, we propose a new self-training framework for domain adaptation, namely Domain adversarial learning enhanced Self-Training Framework (DaMSTF). Firstly, DaMSTF involves meta-learning to estimate the importance of each pseudo instance, so as to simultaneously reduce the label noise and preserve hard examples. Secondly, we design a meta constructor for constructing the meta-validation set, which guarantees the effectiveness of the meta-learning module by improving the quality of the meta-validation set. Thirdly, we find that the meta-learning module suffers from the training guidance vanish- ment and tends to converge to an inferior optimal. To this end, we employ domain adversarial learning as a heuristic neural network initialization method, which can help the meta-learning module converge to a better optimal. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DaMSTF. On the cross-domain sentiment classification task, DaMSTF improves the performance of BERT with an average of nearly 4\\%.","authors":["MenglongLu","ZhenHuang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5777","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77228/poster_document/431b7d9c64c7e1b181b87cd6a1312fc3.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DaMSTF: Domain Adversarial Learning Enhanced Meta Self-Training for Domain Adaptation","tldr":"Self-training emerges as an important research line on domain adaptation.

However, extracting semantic information from speech and modeling the cross-modal correlation pose two critical challenges. Previous studies solve them by representing spoken queries based on the matched video frames, which require tremendous  effort for frame-level labeling. In this work, we investigate weakly-supervised spoken video grounding, i.e., learning to localize moments without expensive temporal annotations. To effectively represent the cross-modal semantics, we propose Semantic Interaction Learning (SIL), a novel framework consisting of the acoustic-semantic pre-training (ASP) and acoustic-visual contrastive learning (AVCL). In ASP, we pre-train an effective encoder for the grounding task with three comprehensive tasks, where the robustness task enhances stability by explicitly capturing the invariance between time- and frequency-domain features, the conciseness task avoids over-smooth attention by compressing long sequence into segments, and the semantic task improves spoken language understanding by modeling the precise semantics. In AVCL, we mine pseudo labels with discriminative sampling strategies and directly strengthen the interaction between speech and video by maximizing their mutual information.

However, these tasks often suffer from limited data availability due to the labor-intensive nature of their annotations. Consequently, recent studies have explored knowledge transfer approaches within a multi-task learning framework to address this challenge. Although such methods have achieved acceptable results, such brute-force solutions struggle to effectively transfer event-relational knowledge due to the vast array of inter-event relations (e.g. temporal, causal, conditional) and reasoning formulations (e.g. discriminative, abductive, ending prediction). To enhance knowledge transfer and enable zero-shot generalization among various combinations, in this work we propose a novel unified framework, called UNIEVENT. Inspired by prefix-based multitask learning, our approach organizes event relational reasoning tasks into a coordinate system with multiple axes, representing inter-event relations and reasoning formulations.

We conduct a thorough empirical investigation on the effect of NEUPSL DSI learning on hidden representation quality, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization performance. Over three dialog structure induction datasets and across unsupervised and semi-supervised settings for standard and cross-domain generalization, the injection of symbolic knowledge using NEUPSL DSI provides a consistent boost in performance over the canonical baselines.","authors":["ConnorF.Pryor"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5810","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77238/poster_document/851dee89def690bf938cb4a6d9fc0c26.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Using Domain Knowledge to Guide Dialog Structure Induction via Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic","tldr":"Dialog Structure Induction (DSI) is the task of inferring the latent dialog structure (i.e., a set of dialog states and their temporal transitions) of a given goal-oriented dialog.

Most prior studies regard SVHR as a classification or ranking problem and select hashtags from a set of limited candidates.

To bridge this gap, we formulate SVHR as a generation task that better represents how hashtags are created naturally. Additionally, we propose the Guided Generative Model (GGM) where we augment the input features by retrieving relevant hashtags from a large-scale hashtag pool as extra guidance signals.

In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a backdoor attack that is both stealthy (i.e., hard to notice) and effective (i.e., has a high attack success rate). We propose BITE, a backdoor attack that poisons the training data to establish strong correlations between the target label and a set of \"trigger words\". These trigger words are iteratively identified and injected into the target-label instances through natural word-level perturbations. The poisoned training data instruct the victim model to predict the target label on inputs containing trigger words, forming the backdoor. Experiments on four text classification datasets show that our proposed attack is significantly more effective than baseline methods while maintaining decent stealthiness, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data.

We present a manually-curated dataset of 1.7k English conversation examples that include situational background information plus for each conversation a set of responses, only some of which are acceptable in the situation. A responsive and informed conversation system should select the appropriate responses and avoid inappropriate ones; doing so demonstrates the ability to adequately understand the initiating request and situation.

A significant amount of important knowledge, however, is represented by hyper-relational facts where each fact is composed of a primal triple and a set of qualifiers comprising a key-value pair that allows for expressing more complicated semantics. Although some recent works have proposed to embed hyper-relational KGs, these methods fail to capture essential inference patterns of hyper-relational facts such as qualifier monotonicity, qualifier implication, and qualifier mutual exclusion, limiting their generalization capability. To unlock this, we present ShrinkE, a geometric hyper-relational KG embedding method aiming to explicitly model these patterns. ShrinkE models the primal triple as a spatial-functional transformation from the head into a relation-specific box. Each qualifier ``shrinks'' the box to narrow down the possible answer set and, thus, realizes qualifier monotonicity. The spatial relationships between the qualifier boxes allow for modeling core inference patterns of qualifiers such as implication and mutual exclusion. Experimental results demonstrate ShrinkE's superiority on three benchmarks of hyper-relational KGs.","authors":["BoXiong","MojtabaNayyeri","ShiruiPan","SteffenStaab"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P605","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76460/poster_document/57e9d04f0f56e808bc0bfaf4dd8521c6.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Shrinking Embeddings for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs","tldr":"Link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) has been extensively studied on binary relational KGs, wherein each fact is represented by a triple.

Our approach is motivated by a key observation that cross-lingual and cross-modal pre-training share the same goal of aligning two different views of the same object into a common semantic space. To this end, the cross-view language modeling framework considers both multi-modal data (i.e., image-caption pairs) and multi-lingual data (i.e., parallel sentence pairs) as two different views of the same object, and trains the model to align the two views by maximizing the mutual information between them with conditional masked language modeling and contrastive learning. We pre-train CCLM, a Cross-lingual Cross-modal Language Model, with the cross-view language modeling framework. Empirical results on IGLUE, a multi-lingual multi-modal benchmark, and two multi-lingual image-text retrieval datasets show that while conceptually simpler, CCLM significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art with an average absolute improvement of over 10\\%. Moreover, CCLM is the first multi-lingual multi-modal pre-trained model that surpasses the translate-test performance of representative English vision-language models by zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.","authors":["YanZeng","WangchunshuZhou","AoLuo","ZimingCheng","XinsongZhang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P608","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Cross-View Language Modeling: Towards Unified Cross-Lingual Cross-Modal Pre-training","tldr":"In this paper, we introduce Cross-View Language Modeling, a simple and effective pre-training framework that unifies cross-lingual and cross-modal pre-training with shared architectures and objectives...","track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","underline_id":76461,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76461-cross-view-language-modeling-towards-unified-cross-lingual-cross-modal-pre-training","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Existing research on multimodal relation extraction (MRE) faces two co-existing challenges, internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation.

Among various existing techniques, multi-task learning is one of the effective ways to share knowledge between ST and MT in which additional MT data can help to learn source-to-target mapping. However, due to the differences between speech and text, there is always a gap between ST and MT. In this paper, we first aim to understand this modality gap from the target-side representation differences, and link the modality gap to another well-known problem in neural machine translation: exposure bias. We find that the modality gap is relatively small during training except for some difficult cases, but keeps increasing during inference due to the cascading effect. To address these problems, we propose the Cross-modal Regularization with Scheduled Sampling (Cress) method. Specifically, we regularize the output predictions of ST and MT, whose target-side contexts are derived by sampling between ground truth words and self-generated words with a varying probability. Furthermore, we introduce token-level adaptive training which assigns different training weights to target tokens to handle difficult cases with large modality gaps. Experiments and analysis show that our approach effectively bridges the modality gap, and achieves significant improvements over a strong baseline in all eight directions of the MuST-C dataset.","authors":["QingkaiFang","YangFeng"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P612","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76463/poster_document/634742c055d684fc1d3508f26ae4c4ce.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Understanding and Bridging the Modality Gap for Speech Translation","tldr":"How to achieve better end-to-end speech translation (ST) by leveraging (text) machine translation (MT) data?

Recently, contrastive learning has been widely adopted which derives high-quality sentence representations by pulling similar semantics closer and pushing dissimilar ones away. However, these methods fail to capture the fine-grained ranking information among the sentences, where each sentence is only treated as either positive or negative. In many real-world scenarios, one needs to distinguish and rank the sentences based on their similarities to a query sentence, e.g., very relevant, moderate relevant, less relevant, irrelevant, etc.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, RankCSE, for unsupervised sentence representation learning, which incorporates ranking consistency and ranking distillation with contrastive learning into a unified framework. In particular, we learn semantically discriminative sentence representations by simultaneously ensuring ranking consistency between two representations with different dropout masks, and distilling listwise ranking knowledge from the teacher.

Most existing systems blend knowledge retrieval with response generation and optimize them with direct supervision from reference responses, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance when the knowledge base becomes large-scale. To address this, we propose to decouple knowledge retrieval from response generation and introduce a multi-grained knowledge retriever (MAKER) that includes an entity selector to search for relevant entities and an attribute selector to filter out irrelevant attributes.

Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness---the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives---generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multi-objective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models.","authors":["YufeiLi","ZexinLi","YingfanGao","CongLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P650","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76468/poster_document/d161f7f0134ed07ecdb2eb0d1d58ec28.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"White-Box Multi-Objective Adversarial Attack on Dialogue Generation","tldr":"Pre-trained transformers are popular in state-of-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems.

While key points are more expressive than word clouds and key phrases, making sense of a long, flat list of key points, which often express related ideas in varying levels of granularity, may still be challenging. To address this limitation of KPA, we introduce the task of organizing a given set of key points into a hierarchy, according to their specificity. Such hierarchies may be viewed as a novel type of Textual Entailment Graph. We develop ThinkP, a high quality benchmark dataset of key point hierarchies for business and product reviews, obtained by consolidating multiple annotations. We compare different methods for predicting pairwise relations between key points, and for inferring a hierarchy from these pairwise predictions. In particular, for the task of computing pairwise key point relations, we achieve significant gains over existing strong baselines by applying directional distributional similarity methods to a novel distributional representation of key points, and further boost performance via weak supervision.","authors":["ArieCattan","LilachEden","YoavKantor","RoyBar-Haim"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P651","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76469/poster_document/985ffbbb8a1fbac9f9ca1df9665c385b.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"From Key Points to Key Point Hierarchy: Structured and Expressive Opinion Summarization","tldr":"Key Point Analysis (KPA) has been recently proposed for deriving fine-grained insights from collections of textual comments.

Resultantly, previous work has focused largely on post-hoc diversification, rather than explicitly learning to predict sets of responses. Motivated by this problem, we present a novel method \\textsc{SimSR}, that employs model-based simulation to discover high-value response sets, through simulating possible user responses with a learned world model. Unlike previous approaches, this allows our method to directly optimise the end-goal of SR--maximising the relevance of at least one of the predicted replies.

Using a 66 billion parameter language model (OPT-66B) across a diverse set of 14 downstream tasks, we find this is indeed the case: ~70\\% of the attention heads and ~20\\% of the feed forward networks can be removed with minimal decline in task performance. We find substantial overlap in the set of attention heads (un)important for in-context learning across tasks and number of in-context examples. We also address our hypothesis through a task-agnostic lens, finding that a small set of attention heads in OPT-66B score highly on their ability to perform primitive induction operations associated with in-context learning, namely, prefix matching and copying. These induction heads overlap with task-specific important heads, reinforcing arguments by Olsson et al. (2022) regarding induction head generality to more sophisticated behaviors associated with in-context learning. Overall, our study provides several insights that indicate large language models may be under-trained for in-context learning and opens up questions on how to pre-train language models to more effectively perform in-context learning.","authors":["HritikBansal","KarthikGopalakrishnan","SaketDingliwal","SravanBodapati","KatrinKirchhoff","DanRoth"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P663","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76471/poster_document/107e737826aae2f0091c598e174cbbe4.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Rethinking the Role of Scale for In-Context Learning: An Interpretability-based Case Study at 66 Billion Scale","tldr":"Language models have been shown to perform better with an increase in scale on a wide variety of tasks via the in-context learning paradigm.

In this work, we present a theoretical analysis where all parameters of a trained Transformer are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space, that is, the space of vocabulary items they operate on. We derive a simple theoretical framework to support our arguments and provide ample evidence for its validity. First, an empirical analysis showing that parameters of both pretrained and fine-tuned models can be interpreted in embedding space. Second, we present two applications of our framework: (a) aligning the parameters of different models that share a vocabulary, and (b) constructing a classifier without training by ``translating'' the parameters of a fine-tuned classifier to parameters of a different model that was only pretrained.

We present NBR, which converts biomedical RE as natural language inference formulation through indirect supervision. By converting relations to natural language hypotheses, NBR is capable of exploiting semantic cues to alleviate annotation scarcity. By incorporating a ranking-based loss that implicitly calibrates abstinent instances, NBR learns a clearer decision boundary and is instructed to abstain on uncertain instances. Extensive experiments on three widely-used biomedical RE benchmarks, namely ChemProt, DDI and GAD, verify the effectiveness of NBR in both full-set and low-resource regimes.

An alternative approach is to leverage existing data in a high-resource language to enable cross-lingual transfer in low-resource language models. However, this type of transfer has not been widely explored in natural language response generation. In this research, we investigate the use of state-of-the-art multilingual models such as mBART and T5 to facilitate zero-shot and few-shot transfer of code-switched responses. We propose a new adapter-based framework that allows for efficient transfer by learning task-specific representations and encapsulating source and target language representations. Our framework is able to successfully transfer language knowledge even when the target language corpus is limited.

Experiments on TB-Dense and MATRES show significant improvements over a strong baseline and outperform the state-of-the-art model by 0.3\\% on both datasets. By representing all relations in a unified framework, we can leverage the relations with sufficient data to assist the learning of other relations, thus achieving stable improvement in low-data scenarios. When the relation definitions are changed, our method can quickly adapt to the new ones by simply modifying the logic expressions that map time points to new event relations.

Although prompt tuning has been shown to match the performance of full model tuning when training data is sufficient, it tends to struggle in few-shot learning settings. In this paper, we present Multi-task Pre-trained Modular Prompt (MP2) to boost prompt tuning for few-shot learning. MP2 is a set of combinable prompts pre-trained on 38 Chinese tasks. On downstream tasks, the pre-trained prompts are selectively activated and combined, leading to strong compositional generalization to unseen tasks. To bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, we formulate upstream and downstream tasks into a unified machine reading comprehension task. Extensive experiments under two learning paradigms, i.e., gradient descent and black-box tuning, show that MP2 significantly outperforms prompt tuning, full model tuning, and prior prompt pre-training methods in few-shot settings. In addition, we demonstrate that MP2 can achieve surprisingly fast and strong adaptation to downstream tasks by merely learning 8 parameters to combine the pre-trained modular prompts.","authors":["TianxiangSun","ZhengfuHe","QinZhu","XipengQiu","XuanjingHuang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P813","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76490/poster_document/65ee7e7b0451961081edb9c476f3689e.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Multitask Pre-training of Modular Prompt for Chinese Few-Shot Learning","tldr":"Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient approach to adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks.

One significant challenge of this task is how to correctly maintain the consistency between the images and the lengthy report. Previous research explored solving this issue through planning-based methods, which generate reports only based on high-level plans. However, these plans usually only contain the major observations from the radiographs (e.g., lung opacity), lacking much necessary information, such as the observation characteristics and preliminary clinical diagnoses. To address this problem, the system should also take the image information into account together with the textual plan and perform stronger reasoning during the generation process. In this paper, we propose an Observation-guided radiology Report Generation framework (ORGan). It first produces an observation plan and then feeds both the plan and radiographs for report generation, where an observation graph and a tree reasoning mechanism are adopted to precisely enrich the plan information by capturing the multi-formats of each observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods regarding text quality and clinical efficacy.","authors":["WenjunHou","KaishuaiXu","YiCheng","WenjieLi","JiangLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P819","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76491/poster_document/d7f9c657f067d19e66440ef18d19804e.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"ORGAN: Observation-Guided Radiology Report Generation via Tree Reasoning","tldr":"This paper explores the task of radiology report generation, which aims at generating free-text descriptions for a set of radiographs.

Our module 1 designs various types of attention for event representation learning to capture long-distance dependence. 2) High density in a sentence makes SECI relatively easy. Module 2 uses different weights to highlight the roles and contributions of intra- and inter-sentential reasoning, which introduces supportive event pairs for joint modeling.

BLASER leverages a multilingual multimodal encoder to directly encode the speech segments for source input, translation output and reference into a shared embedding space and computes a score of the translation quality that can be used as a proxy to human evaluation. To evaluate our approach, we construct training and evaluation sets from more than 40k human annotations covering seven language directions.\n\nThe best results of BLASER are achieved by training with supervision from human rating scores. We show that when evaluated at the sentence level, BLASER correlates significantly better with human judgment compared to ASR dependent metrics including ASR-SENTBLEU in all translation directions and ASR-COMET in five of them. Our analysis shows combining speech and text as inputs to BLASER does not increase the correlation with human scores, but best correlations are achieved when using speech, which motivates the goal of our research. Moreover, we show that using ASR for references is detrimental for text-based metrics.","authors":["MingdaChen","Paul-AmbroiseAugustinDuquenne","PierreY.Andrews","JustineT.Kao","AlexandreMourachko","HolgerSchwenk","MartaR.Costa-juss\u00e0"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-speech-and-multimodality-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P867","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"BLASER: A Text-Free Speech-to-Speech Translation Evaluation Metric","tldr":"End-to-End speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is generally evaluated with text-based metrics.

However, vanilla fine-tuning easily overfits the target data and degrades the generalization ability. Most existing studies attribute it to catastrophic forgetting, and they retain the pre-trained knowledge indiscriminately without identifying what knowledge is transferable. Motivated by this, we frame fine-tuning into a causal graph and discover that the crux of catastrophic forgetting lies in the missing causal effects from the pre-trained data.  Based on the causal view, we propose a unified objective for fine-tuning to retrieve the causality back. Intriguingly, the unified objective can be seen as the sum of the vanilla fine-tuning objective, which learns new knowledge from target data, and the causal objective, which preserves old knowledge from PLMs. Therefore, our method is flexible and can mitigate negative transfer while preserving knowledge. Since endowing models with commonsense is a long-standing challenge, we implement our method on commonsense QA with a proposed heuristic estimation to verify its effectiveness. In the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on all six commonsense QA datasets and can be implemented as a plug-in module to inflate the performance of existing QA models.","authors":["JunhaoZheng","QianliMa","ShengjieQiu","YueWu","PeitianMa","JunlongLiu","HuawenFeng","XichenShang","HaibinChen"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-3_-large-language-models-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P868","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76206/poster_document/844281f24a2f4b55b67bfdedbed928cd.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Preserving Commonsense Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models via Causal Inference","tldr":"Fine-tuning has been proven to be a simple and effective technique to transfer the learned knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks.

While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall.","authors":["UriShaham","MahaElbayad","VedanujGoswami","OmerLevy","ShrutiBhosale"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Oral","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-6_-machine-translation-(oral)"],"forum":"","id":"P899","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76209/poster_document/0d931013d563d24591f2d59c786f5c9a.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Causes and Cures for Interference in Multilingual Translation","tldr":"Multilingual machine translation models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs, but also suffer from interference.

We provide two key contributions. 1) Relying on a multilingual multi-modal encoder, we provide a systematic empirical study of standard methods used in cross-lingual NLP when applied to mTTI: Translate Train, Translate Test, and Zero-Shot Transfer. 2) We propose Ensemble Adapter (EnsAd), a novel parameter-efficient approach that learns to weigh and consolidate the multilingual text knowledge within the mTTI framework, mitigating the language gap and thus improving mTTI performance. Our evaluations on standard mTTI datasets COCO-CN, Multi30K Task2, and LAION-5B demonstrate the potential of translation-enhanced mTTI systems and also validate the benefits of the proposed EnsAd which derives consistent gains across all datasets. Further investigations on model variants, ablation studies, and qualitative analyses provide additional insights on the inner workings of the proposed mTTI approaches.","authors":["YaoyiranLi","Ching-YunChang","StephenRawls","IvanVuli\u0107","AnnaKorhonen"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P907","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76503/poster_document/764ca18e90be79bafef828b7bee2fe38.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Translation-Enhanced Multilingual Text-to-Image Generation","tldr":"Research on text-to-image generation (TTI) still predominantly focuses on the English language due to the lack of annotated image-caption data in other languages; in the long run, this might widen ine...","track":"Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond","underline_id":76503,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76503-translation-enhanced-multilingual-text-to-image-generation","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52451/file/44792ed57d1442fa396c276815897747.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085045Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=cc8321f32f3f4986dfb6d631c643c5ea716658c3ce7f72dd6072d4e283103c2c"},{"abstract":"Unpaired cross-lingual image captioning has long suffered from irrelevancy and disfluency issues, due to the inconsistencies of the semantic scene and syntax attributes during transfer.

For example, persuading someone to reconsider smoking might involve empathetic, well founded arguments based on facts and expert opinions about its ill-effects and the consequences on one's family. However, the automatic generation of high-quality factual arguments can be challenging. Addressing existing controllability issues can make the recent advances in computational models for argument generation a potential solution. In this paper, we introduce ArgU: a neural argument generator capable of producing factual arguments from input facts and real-world concepts that can be explicitly controlled for stance and argument structure using Walton's argument scheme-based control codes. Unfortunately, computational argument generation is a relatively new field and lacks datasets conducive to training. Hence, we have compiled and released an annotated corpora of 69,428 arguments spanning six topics and six argument schemes, making it the largest publicly available corpus for identifying argument schemes; the paper details our annotation and dataset creation framework. We further experiment with an argument generation strategy that establishes an inference strategy by generating an ``argument template'' before actual argument generation. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically generate diverse arguments exhibiting different inference patterns for the same set of facts by using control codes based on argument schemes and stance.","authors":["SougataSaha","RohiniK.Srihari"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P909","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76504/poster_document/2b307ebcbc3227f93724f74b2b99cd4f.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"ArgU: A Controllable Factual Argument Generator","tldr":"Effective argumentation is essential towards a purposeful conversation with a satisfactory outcome.

Advances in automated event extraction have yielded massive data sets of \"who did what to whom\" micro-records that enable data-driven approaches to monitoring conflict.

It is based only on the action category (\"what\") and disregards the subject (\"who\") and object (\"to whom\") of an event, as well as contextual information, like associated casualty count, that should contribute to the perception of an event's \"intensity\". This paper takes a latent variable-based approach to measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model that assumes each observed event is associated with a latent intensity class. A novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such that higher-valued classes denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal nature of the latent variable is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher intensity.

Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks.

Unstructured clinical notes, which contain a vast amount of information, are a valuable resource for electronic phenotyping. However, traditional methods, such as rule-based labeling functions or neural networks, require significant manual effort to tune and may not generalize well to multiple indications. To address these challenges, we propose \\textit{HyDE} (hybrid diagnosis extractor). HyDE is a simple framework for electronic phenotyping that integrates labeling functions and a disease-agnostic neural network to assign diagnoses to patients. By training HyDE's model to correct predictions made by labeling functions, we are able to disambiguate hypertension true positives and false positives with a supervised area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.85. We extend this hypertension-trained model to zero-shot evaluation of four other diseases, generating AUPRC values ranging from 0.82 - 0.95 and outperforming a labeling function baseline by 44 points in F1 score and a Word2Vec baseline by 24 points in F1 score on average. Furthermore, we demonstrate a speedup of >4x by pruning the length of inputs into our language model to  ~2.3\\% of the full clinical notes, with negligible impact to the AUPRC. HyDE has the potential to improve the efficiency and efficacy of interpreting large-scale unstructured clinical notes for accurate EHR phenotyping.","authors":["LouisBlankemeier","JasonFries","RobertTinn","JosephS.Preston","NigamShah","AkshayChaudhari"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-nlp-applications-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P955","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Efficient Diagnosis Assignment Using Unstructured Clinical Notes","tldr":"Electronic phenotyping entails using electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients with specific health outcomes and determine when those outcomes occurred.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense retrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained expression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching signal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and two unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint in training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit balance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level view and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a fine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage representation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching information from the passage containing complex context.

In the first stage (Think -- retrieval of associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum -- probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the possibilities and advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of LLM evaluation tasks, achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on thirteen difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We also compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. Our results suggest that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design, yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs. Overall, our proposed paradigm represents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.","authors":["BatuM.Ozturkler","NikolayMalkin","ZhenWang","NebojsaJojic"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Main-Poster","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P987","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/76515/poster_document/6b65bbe3c4775306d3fd4f1283ffadec.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"ThinkSum: Probabilistic reasoning over sets using large language models","tldr":"Large language models (LLMs) have a substantial capacity for high-level analogical reasoning: reproducing patterns in linear text that occur in their training data (zero-shot evaluation) or in the pro...","track":"Large Language Models","underline_id":76515,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/76515-thinksum-probabilistic-reasoning-over-sets-using-large-language-models","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52464/file/3a6f8e485827854a4b1522da725237d9.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085045Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=8ca162460f1fd116a4821be4bed6cc7e41c8c2ec16af8579c28f53c59edf5ff1"},{"abstract":"We study grammar induction with mildly context-sensitive grammars for unsupervised discontinuous parsing.

However, their event proposals are obtained via visual feature clustering, which is query-independent and inaccurate; and the pseudo-queries are short or less interpretable. Moreover, existing approaches ignores the risk of pseudo-label noise when leveraging them in training. To address the above problems, we propose a Structure-based Pseudo Label generation (SPL), which first generate free-form interpretable pseudo queries before constructing query-dependent event proposals by modeling the event temporal structure. To mitigate the effect of pseudo-label noise, we propose a noise-resistant iterative method that repeatedly re-weight the training sample based on noise estimation to train a grounding model and correct pseudo labels. Experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

This paper bridges the singability quality gap by formalizing lyric translation into a constrained translation problem, converting theoretical guidance and practical techniques from translatology literature to prompt-driven NMT approaches, exploring better adaptation methods, and instantiating them to an English-Chinese lyric translation system. Our model achieves 99.85\\%, 99.00\\%, and 95.52\\% on length accuracy, rhyme accuracy, and word boundary recall. In our subjective evaluation, our model shows a 75\\% relative enhancement on overall quality, compared against naive fine-tuning (Code available at

But I argue that this is the wrong question. Intelligence and agency are the wrong categories for understanding them. Instead, these Al systems are what we might call cultural technologies, like writing, print, libraries, internet search engines or even language itself. They are new techniques for passing on information from one group of people to another. Cultural technologies arent like intelligent humans, but they are essential for human intelligence. Many animals can transmit some information from one individual or one generation to another, but no animal does it as much as we do or accumulates as much information over time, . New technologies that make cultural transmission easier and more effective have been among the greatest engines of human progress, but they have also led to negative as well as positive social consequences. Moreover, while cultural technologies allow transmission of existing information cultural evolution, which is central to human success, also depends on innovation, exploration and causal learning. Comparing LLM\u2019s responses in prompts based on developmental psychology experiments to the responses of children may provide insight into which capacities can be learned through language and cultural transmission, and which require innovation and exploration in the physical world. I will present results from several studies making such comparisons.","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["keynote-2_-alison-gopnik_-keynote-2_-alison-gopnik-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_keynote-2_-alison-gopnik_-keynote-2_-alison-gopnik-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Keynote 2: Alison Gopnik","tldr":"","track":"keynote-2_-alison-gopnik","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["plenary_-acl-lifetime----tot_-plenary_-acl-lifetime----tot-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_plenary_-acl-lifetime----tot_-plenary_-acl-lifetime----tot-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Plenary: ACL Lifetime -- ToT","tldr":"","track":"plenary_-acl-lifetime----tot","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["plenary_-best-paper-awards_-plenary_-best-paper-awards-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_plenary_-best-paper-awards_-plenary_-best-paper-awards-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Plenary: Best Paper Awards","tldr":"","track":"plenary_-best-paper-awards","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["plenary_-business-meeting_-plenary_-business-meeting-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_plenary_-business-meeting_-plenary_-business-meeting-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Plenary: Business Meeting","tldr":"","track":"plenary_-business-meeting","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["plenary_-closing-session_-plenary_-closing-session-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_plenary_-closing-session_-plenary_-closing-session-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Plenary: Closing Session","tldr":"","track":"plenary_-closing-session","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["plenary_-llm-panel_-plenary_-llm-panel-(plenary-sessions)"],"forum":"","id":"event_plenary_-llm-panel_-plenary_-llm-panel-(plenary-sessions)","is_paper":false,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Plenary Sessions","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Main","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Plenary: LLM Panel","tldr":"","track":"plenary_-llm-panel","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"We have planned the following social events for ACL 2023.
