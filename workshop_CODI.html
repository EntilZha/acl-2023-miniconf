      The last ten years have seen a dramatic improvement in the ability of NLP systems to understand and produce words and sentences. This development has created a renewed interest in discourse phenomena as researchers move towards the processing of long-form text and conversations. There is a surge of activity in discourse parsing, coherence models, text summarization, corpora for discourse level reading comprehension, and discourse related/aided representation learning, to name a few, but the problems in computational approaches to discourse are still substantial. At this juncture, we have organized three Workshops on Computational Approaches to Discourse (CODI) at EMNLP 2020, EMNLP 2021 and COLING 2022 to bring together discourse experts and upcoming researchers. These workshops have catalyzed work to improve the speed and knowledge needed to solve such problems and have served as a forum for the discussion of suitable datasets and reliable evaluation methods.

            <p class="card-text">Scientific publications follow conventionalized rhetorical structures. Classifying the Argumentative Zone (AZ), e.g., identifying whether a sentence states a Motivation, a Result or Background information, has been proposed to improve processing of scholarly documents. In this work, we adapt and extend this idea to the domain of materials science research. We present and release a new dataset of 50 manually annotated research articles. The dataset spans seven sub-topics and is annotated with a materials-science focused multi-label annotation scheme for AZ. We detail corpus statistics and demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement. Our computational experiments show that using domain-specific pre-trained transformer-based text encoders is key to high classification performance. We also find that AZ categories from existing datasets in other domains are transferable to varying degrees.</p>

            Entity Coreference and Co-occurrence Aware Argument Mining from Biomedical Literature

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Boyang Liu, Viktor Schlegel, Riza Batista-navarro, Sophia Ananiadou</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Biomedical argument mining (BAM) aims at automatically identifying the argumentative structure in biomedical texts. However, identifying and classifying argumentative relations (AR) between argumentative components (AC) is challenging since it not only needs to understand the semantics of ACs but also need to capture the interactions between them. We argue that entities can serve as bridges that connect different ACs since entities and their mentions convey significant semantic information in biomedical argumentation. For example, it is common that related AC pairs share a common entity. Capturing such entity information can be beneficial for the Relation Identification (RI) task. In order to incorporate this entity information into BAM, we propose an Entity Coreference and Co-occurrence aware Argument Mining (ECCAM) framework based on an edge-oriented graph model for BAM. We evaluate our model on a benchmark dataset and from the experimental results we find that our method improves upon state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            Chinese-DiMLex: A Lexicon of Chinese Discourse Connectives

          <div class="card-body">

            <p class="card-text">Machine-readable inventories of discourse connectives that provide information on multiple levels are valuable resources for automated discourse analysis, e.g. discourse parsing, machine translation, text summarization and argumentation mining. While there are already several connective lexicons available for certain languages (such as German, English, French, Czech, Portuguese, Hebrew, and Spanish), currently, there is no such resource available for Chinese, despite it being one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. To address this gap, we developed the Chinese-DimLex, a discourse lexicon for Chinese (Mandarin). It features 137 Chinese connectives () and is augmented with five layers of information, specifically morphological variations, syntactic categories (part-of-speech), semantic relations (PDTB3.0 sense inventory), usage examples, and English translations. Chinese-DimLex is publicly accessible in both XML format and through an easy-to-use web-interface, which enables browsing and searching of the lexicon, as well as comparison of discourse connectives across different languages based on their syntactic and semantic properties. In this extended abstract, we provide an overview of the data and the workflow used to populate the lexicon, followed by discussion of several Chinese-specific considerations and issues that arose during the process. By submitting this abstract, we aim to a) contribute to discourse research and b) receive feedback to promote and expand the lexicon for future work.</p>

            A Weakly-Supervised Learning Approach to the Identification of &#34;Alternative Lexicalizations&#34; in Shallow Discourse Parsing
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Ren{\&#39;e} Knaebel</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Recently, the identification of free connective phrases as signals for discourse relations has received new attention with the introduction of statistical models for their automatic extraction. The limited amount of annotations makes it still challenging to develop well-performing models. In our work, we want to overcome this limitation with semi-supervised learning from unlabeled news texts. We implement a self-supervised sequence labeling approach and filter its predictions by a second model trained to disambiguate signal candidates. With our novel model design, we report state-of-the-art results and in addition, achieve an average improvement of about 5\% for both exactly and partially matched alternativelylexicalized discourse signals due to weak supervision.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Discourse-aware techniques, including entity-aware approaches, play a crucial role in summarization. In this paper, we propose an entity-based SpanCopy mechanism to tackle the entity-level factual inconsistency problem in abstractive summarization, i.e. reducing the mismatched entities between the generated summaries and the source documents. Complemented by a Global Relevance component to identify summary-worthy entities, our approach demonstrates improved factual consistency while preserving saliency on four summarization datasets, contributing to the effective application of discourse-aware methods summarization tasks.</p>

            Discourse Information for Document-Level Temporal Dependency Parsing

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Jingcheng Niu, Victoria Ng, Erin Rees, Simon De Montigny, Gerald Penn</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In this study, we examine the benefits of incorporating discourse information into document-level temporal dependency parsing. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of integrating both high-level discourse profiling information, which describes the discourse function of sentences, and surface-level sentence position information into temporal dependency graph (TDG) parsing. Unexpectedly, our results suggest that simple sentence position information, particularly when encoded using our novel sentence-position embedding method, performs the best, perhaps because it does not rely on noisy model-generated feature inputs. Our proposed system surpasses the current state-of-the-art TDG parsing systems in performance.Furthermore, we aim to broaden the discussion on the relationship between temporal dependency parsing and discourse analysis, given the substantial similarities shared between the two tasks. We argue that discourse analysis results should not be merely regarded as an additional input feature for temporal dependency parsing. Instead, adopting advanced discourse analysis techniques and research insights can lead to more effective and comprehensive approaches to temporal information extraction tasks.</p>

The qualitative analysis shows that while complex discourse units often match between analyses, QUD structures do not indicate the centrality of segments.</p>

We investigate multiple tasks for fine-tuning and show that the dialogue-tailored Sentence Ordering task performs best. To locate and exploit discourse information in PLMs, we propose an unsupervised and a semi-supervised method. Our proposals thereby achieve encouraging results on the STAC corpus, with F1 scores of 57.2 and 59.3 for the unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, respectively. When restricted to projective trees, our scores improved to 63.3 and 68.1.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In discourse relation recognition, the classification labels are typically represented as one-hot vectors. However, the categories are in fact not all independent of one another  on the contrary, there are several frameworks that describe the labels&#39; similarities (by e.g. sorting them into a hierarchy or describing them interms of features (Sanders et al., 2021)). Recently, several methods for representing the similarities between labels have been proposed (Zhang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Xiong et al., 2021). We here explore and extend the Label Confusion Model (Guo et al., 2021) for learning a representation for discourse relation labels. We explore alternative ways of informing the model about the similarities between relations, by representing relations in terms of their names (and parent category), their typical markers, or in terms of CCR features that describe the relations. Experimental results show that exploiting label similarity improves classification results.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Incorporating external knowledge, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), into neural topic modeling has achieved great success in recent years. However, employing PLMs for topic modeling generally ignores the maximum sequence length of PLMs and the interaction between external knowledge and bag-of-words (BOW). To this end, we propose a sentence-aware encoder for neural topic modeling, which adopts fine-grained sentence embeddings as external knowledge to entirely utilize the semantic information of input documents. We introduce sentence-aware attention for document representation, where BOW enables the model to attend on topical sentences that convey topic-related cues. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art neural topic models in topic coherence. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield better latent document-topic features through improvement on the document classification.</p>

            Improving Long Context Document-Level Machine Translation

            <p class="card-text">Document-level context for neural machine translation (NMT) is crucial to improve the translation consistency and cohesion, the translation of ambiguous inputs, as well as several other linguistic phenomena.Many works have been published on the topic of document-level NMT, but most restrict the system to only local context, typically including just the one or two preceding sentences as additional information.This might be enough to resolve some ambiguous inputs, but it is probably not sufficient to capture some document-level information like the topic or style of a conversation.When increasing the context size beyond just the local context, there are two challenges: (i) the memory usage increases exponentially (ii) the translation performance starts to degrade.We argue that the widely-used attention mechanism is responsible for both issues.Therefore, we propose a constrained attention variant that focuses the attention on the most relevant parts of the sequence, while simultaneously reducing the memory consumption.For evaluation, we utilize targeted test sets in combination with novel evaluation techniques to analyze the translations in regards to specific discourse-related phenomena.We find that our approach is a good compromise between sentence-level NMT vs attending to the full context, especially in low resource scenarios.</p>

In these datasets, examples are two-part sentences with an implicit discourse relation that can be ambiguously read as either causal or concessive, paired with two different preceding context sentences forcing either the causal or the concessive reading. We also validated both datasets by humans and language models (LMs) to study whether context can help humans or LMs resolve ambiguities of implicit relations and identify the intended relation.

This work instead adopts the linguistic framework of Questions Under Discussion (QUD) for discourse analysis and seeks to derive QUD structures automatically. QUD views each sentence as an answer to a question triggered in prior context; thus, we characterize relationships between sentences as free-form questions, in contrast to exhaustive fine-grained taxonomies. We develop the first-of-its-kind QUD parser that derives a dependency structure of questions over full documents, trained using a large, crowdsourced question-answering dataset DCQA (Ko et al., 2022). Strong human evaluation results show that QUD dependency parsing is highly feasible under this crowdsourced, generalizable annotation scheme. We illustrate how our QUD structure is distinct from RST trees, and demonstrate the utility of QUD analysis in the context of document simplification. Our findings show that QUD parsing is an appealing alternative for automatic discourse processing.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Text simplification research has mostly focused on sentence-level simplification, even though many desirable edits --- such as adding relevant background information or reordering content --- may require document-level context.Prior work has also predominantly framed simplification as a single-step, input-to-output task, only implicitly modeling the fine-grained, span-level edits that elucidate the simplification process.To address both gaps, we introduce the SWiPE dataset, which reconstructs the document-level editing process from English Wikipedia (EW) articles to paired Simple Wikipedia (SEW) articles. In contrast to prior work, SWiPE leverages the entire revision history when pairing pages in order to better identify simplification edits. We work with Wikipedia editors to annotate 5,000 EW-SEW document pairs, labeling more than 40,000 edits with proposed 19 categories.To scale our efforts, we propose several models to automatically label edits, achieving an F-1 score of up to 70.6, indicating that this is a tractable but challenging NLU task. Finally, we categorize the edits produced by several simplification models and find that SWiPE-trained models generate more complex edits while reducing unwanted edits.</p>

            <p class="card-text">While a large body of literature suggests that large language models (LLMs) acquire rich linguistic representations, little is known about whether they adapt to linguistic biases in a human-like way. The present study probes this question by comparing InstructGPT&#39;s performance on learning referential biases with results from real psycholinguistic experiments. Recent psycholinguistic studies suggest that humans adapt their referential biases with exposure to referential patterns; closely replicating three relevant psycholinguistic experiments from Johnson and Arnold (2022) in an in-context learning (ICL) framework, we found that InstructGPT adapts its pronominal interpretations in response to the frequency of referential patterns in the local discourse, though in a limited fashion: adaptation was only observed relative to syntactic but not semantic biases. Our results provide further evidence that contemporary LLMs discourse representations are sensitive to syntactic patterns in the local context but less so to semantic patterns.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Transforming narrative structure to implicit discourse relations in long-form text has recently seen a mindset shift toward assessing generation consistency. To this extent, summarization of lengthy biographical discourse is of practical benefit to readers, as it helps them decide whether immersing for days or weeks in a bulky book turns a rewarding experience. Machine-generated summaries can reduce the cognitive load and the time spent by authors to write the summary. Nevertheless, summarization faces significant challenges of factual inconsistencies with respect to the inputs. In this paper, we explored a two-step summary generation aimed to retain source-summary faithfulness. Our method uses a graph representation to rank sentence saliency in each of the novel chapters, leading to distributing summary segments in distinct regions of the chapter. Basing on the previously extracted sentences we produced an abstractive summary in a manner more computationally tractable for detecting inconsistent information. We conducted a series of quantitative analyses on a test set of four long biographical novels and showed to improve summarization quality in automatic evaluation over both single-tier settings and external baselines.</p>

In this work, we adapt a system of DRs for written language to spontaneous dialogue using crowdsourced annotations from novice annotators. We then test whether discourse relations are used differently across several types of multi-utterance contexts. We compare the patterns of DR annotation within and across speakers and within and across turns. Ultimately, we find that different discourse contexts produce distinct distributions of discourse relations, with single-turn annotations creating the most uncertainty for annotators. Additionally, we find that the discourse relation annotations are of sufficient quality to predict from embeddings of discourse units.</p>

            <p class="card-text">[Findings Paper]To date, most work on text simplification has focused on sentence-level inputs. Early attempts at document simplification merely applied these approaches iteratively over the sentences of a document. However, this fails to coherently preserve the discourse structure, leading to suboptimal output quality. Recently, strategies from controllable simplification have been leveraged to achieve state-of-the-art results on document simplification by first generating a document-level plan (a sequence of sentence-level simplification operations) and using this plan to guide sentence-level simplification downstream. However, this is still limited in that the simplification model has no direct access to the local inter-sentence document context, likely having a negative impact on surface realisation. We explore various systems that use document context within the simplification process itself, either by iterating over larger text units or by extending the system architecture to attend over a high-level representation of document context. In doing so, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the document simplification task, even when not relying on plan-guidance. Further, we investigate the performance and efficiency tradeoffs of system variants and make suggestions of when each should be preferred.</p>

While it is hard to prevent biases in news, they should be identified for better transparency. We propose an approach to automatically characterize biases that takes into account structural differences and that is efficient for long texts. This yields new ways to provide explanations for a textual classifier, going beyond mere lexical cues. We show that: (i) the use of discourse-based structure-aware document representations compare well to local, computationally heavy, or domain-specific models on classification tasks that deal with textual bias (ii) our approach based on different levels of granularity allows for the generation of better explanations of model decisions, both at the lexical and structural level, while addressing the challenge posed by long texts.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Event Coreference Resolution (ECR) is the task of linking mentions of the same event either within or across documents. Most mention pairs are not coreferent, yet many that are coreferent can be identified through simple techniques such as lemma matching of the event triggers or the sentences in which they appear. Existing methods for training coreference systems sample from a largely skewed distribution, making it difficult for the algorithm to learn coreference beyond surface matching. Additionally, these methods are intractable because of the quadratic operations needed. To address these challenges, we break the problem of ECR into two parts: a) a heuristic to efficiently filter out a large number of non-coreferent pairs, and b) a training approach on a balanced set of coreferent and non-coreferent mention pairs. By following this approach, we show that we get comparable results to the state of the art on two popular ECR datasets while significantly reducing compute requirements. We also analyze the mention pairs that are &#34;hard&#34; to accurately classify as coreferent or non-coreferent. This is an accepted Findings paper at ACL 2023</p>

Here the cosine similarity indicates the distance/reachability of a candidate utterance toward the corresponding goal. Furthermore, we explore how these forward-entailing language representations can be utilized for assessing the likelihood of sequences by the entailment strength i.e. through the cosine similarity of its individual members (encoded separately) as an emergent property in the curved space. These non-local properties allow us to imagine the likelihood of future patterns in dialogues, specifically by ordering/identifying future goal utterances that are multiple turns away, given a dialogue context. As part of our analysis, we investigate characteristics that make conversations (un)plannable and find strong evidence of planning capability over multiple turns (in 61.56% over 3 turns) in conversations from the DailyDialog dataset. Finally, we show how we achieve higher efficiency in sequence modeling tasks compared to previous work thanks to our relativistic approach, where only the last utterance needs to be encoded and computed during inference.</p>

            Ensemble Transfer Learning for Multilingual Coreference Resolution
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Tuan Lai, Heng Ji</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Entity coreference resolution is an important research problem with many applications, including information extraction and question answering. Coreference resolution for English has been studied extensively. However, there is relatively little work for other languages. A problem that frequently occurs when working with a non-English language is the scarcity of annotated training data. To overcome this challenge, we design a simple but effective ensemble-based framework that combines various transfer learning (TL) techniques. We first train several models using different TL methods. Then, during inference, we compute the unweighted average scores of the models&#39; predictions to extract the final set of predicted clusters. Furthermore, we also propose a low-cost TL method that bootstraps coreference resolution models by utilizing Wikipedia anchor texts. Leveraging the idea that the coreferential links naturally exist between anchor texts pointing to the same article, our method builds a sizeable distantly-supervised dataset for the target language that consists of tens of thousands of documents. We can pre-train a model on the pseudo-labeled dataset before finetuning it on the final target dataset. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, OntoNotes and SemEval, confirm the effectiveness of our methods. Our best ensembles consistently outperform the baseline approach of simple training by up to 7.68\% in the F1 score. These ensembles also achieve new state-of-the-art results for three languages: Arabic, Dutch, and Spanish.</p>

            Contrastive Hierarchical Discourse Graph for Scientific Document Summarization
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Haopeng Zhang, Xiao Liu, Jiawei Zhang</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The extended structural context has made scientific paper summarization a challenging task. This paper proposes CHANGES, a contrastive hierarchical graph neural network for extractive scientific paper summarization. CHANGES represents a scientific paper with a hierarchical discourse graph and learns effective sentence representations with dedicated designed hierarchical graph information aggregation. We also propose a graph contrastive learning module to learn global theme-aware sentence representations. Extensive experiments on the PubMed and arXiv benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of CHANGES and the importance of capturing hierarchical structure information in modeling scientific papers.</p>

    We calculate the number of new messages for every channel in the last N seconds. Then, we sort them descendingly.
    Channels with no new messages will be randomly shuffled. Please note that the number of messages might not be accurate.
