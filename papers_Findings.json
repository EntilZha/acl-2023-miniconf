[{"abstract":"Steering language generation towards objectives or away from undesired content has been a long-standing goal in utilizing language models (LM). Recent work has demonstrated reinforcement learning and weighted decoding as effective approaches to achieve a higher level of language control and quality with pros and cons. In this work, we propose a novel critic decoding method for controlled language generation (CriticControl) that combines the strengths of reinforcement learning and weighted decoding. Specifically, we adopt the actor-critic framework and train an LM-steering critic from reward models. Similar to weighted decoding, our method freezes the language model and manipulates the output token distribution using a critic to improve training efficiency and stability. Evaluation of our method on three controlled generation tasks, topic control, sentiment control, and detoxification, shows that our approach generates more coherent and well-controlled texts than previous methods. In addition, CriticControl demonstrates superior generalization ability in zero-shot settings. Human evaluation studies also corroborate our findings.","authors":["MinbeomKim","HwanheeLee","Kang MinYoo","JoonsukPark","HwaranLee","KyominJung"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-generation-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P1018","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77394/poster_document/b058a85f0c3eaf3c5d5a5e24034e4f44.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Critic-Guided Decoding for Controlled Text Generation","tldr":"Steering language generation towards objectives or away from undesired content has been a long-standing goal in utilizing language models (LM).

Thus, automatically detecting fake news videos has been an important countermeasure in practice. Previous works commonly verify each news video individually with multimodal information. Nevertheless, news videos from different perspectives regarding the same event are commonly posted together, which contain complementary or contradictory information and thus can be used to evaluate each other mutually. To this end, we introduce a new and practical paradigm, i.e., cross-sample fake news video detection, and propose a novel framework, Neighbor-Enhanced fakE news video Detection (NEED), which integrates the neighborhood relationship of new videos belonging to the same event. NEED can be readily combined with existing single-sample detectors and further enhance their performances with the proposed graph aggregation (GA) and debunking rectification (DR) modules. Specifically, given the feature representations obtained from single-sample detectors, GA aggregates the neighborhood information with the dynamic graph to enrich the features of independent samples. After that, DR explicitly leverages the relationship between debunking videos and fake news videos to refute the candidate videos via textual and visual consistency. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that NEED greatly improves the performance of both single-modal (up to 8.34\\% in accuracy) and multimodal (up to 4.97\\% in accuracy) base detectors.","authors":["PengQi","YuyangZhao","YufengShen","WeiJi","JuanCao","Tat-SengChua"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1047","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77401/poster_document/496758250b686af66330986c4a4af911.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Two Heads Are Better Than One: Improving Fake News Video Detection by Correlating with Neighbors","tldr":"The prevalence of short video platforms has spawned a lot of fake news videos, which have stronger propagation ability than textual fake news.

To alleviate the problem, it might be possible to generate long-document QA pairs via unsupervised question answering (UQA) methods. However, existing UQA tasks are based on short documents, and can hardly incorporate long-range information. To tackle the problem, we propose a new task, named unsupervised long-document question answering (ULQA), aiming to generate high-quality long-document QA instances in an unsupervised manner. Besides, we propose AttenWalker, a novel unsupervised method to aggregate and generate answers with long-range dependency so as to construct long-document QA pairs. Specifically, AttenWalker is composed of three modules, i.e. span collector, span linker and answer aggregator. Firstly, the span collector takes advantage of constituent parsing and reconstruction loss to select informative candidate spans for constructing answers. Secondly, with the help of the attention graph of a pre-trained long-document model, potentially interrelated text spans (that might be far apart) could be linked together via an attention-walking algorithm. Thirdly, in the answer aggregator, linked spans are aggregated into the final answer via the mask-filling ability of a pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that AttenWalker outperforms previous methods on NarrativeQA and Qasper. In addition, AttenWalker also shows strong performance in the few-shot learning setting.","authors":["YuxiangNie","HeyanHuang","WeiWei","Xian-LingMao"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1056","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77402/poster_document/d31dc86fc77617da2aed7fdb1dc901f3.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"AttenWalker: Unsupervised Long-Document Question Answering via Attention-based Graph Walking","tldr":"Annotating long-document question answering (long-document QA) pairs is time-consuming and expensive.

Due to the diverse levels of informational content related to emotion, three modalities typically possess varying degrees of contribution to emotion recognition. More seriously, there might be inconsistencies between the emotion of individual modality and the video. The challenges mentioned above are caused by the inherent uncertainty of emotion. Inspired by the recent advances of quantum theory in modeling uncertainty, we make an initial attempt to design a quantum-inspired adaptive-priority-learning model (QAP) to address the challenges. Specifically, the quantum state is introduced to model modal features, which allows each modality to retain all emotional tendencies until the final classification. Additionally, we design Q-attention to orderly integrate three modalities, and then QAP learns modal priority adaptively so that modalities can provide different amounts of information based on priority. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MOSEI datasets show that QAP establishes new state-of-the-art results.","authors":["ZimingLi","YanZhou","YaxinLiu","FuqingZhu","ChuanpengYang","SonglinHu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P106","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77264/poster_document/8c6524c31ef62a5698e8278c2df650bb.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"QAP: A Quantum-Inspired Adaptive-Priority-Learning Model for Multimodal Emotion Recognition","tldr":"Multimodal emotion recognition for video has gained considerable attention in recent years, in which three modalities (\\emph{i.e.,} textual, visual and acoustic) are involved.

However, it is not well understood why contrastive learning works for learning sentence-level semantics. In this paper, we aim to help guide future designs of sentence representation learning methods by taking a closer look at contrastive SRL through the lens of isotropy, contextualization and learning dynamics. We interpret its successes through the geometry of the representation shifts and show that contrastive learning brings isotropy, and drives high intra-sentence similarity: when in the same sentence, tokens converge to similar positions in the semantic space. We also find that what we formalize as \"spurious contextualization\" is mitigated for semantically meaningful tokens, while augmented for functional ones. We find that the embedding space is directed towards the origin during training, with more areas now better defined. We ablate these findings by observing the learning dynamics with different training temperatures, batch sizes and pooling methods.","authors":["ChenghaoXiao","YangLong","NouraAl Moubayed"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-semantics_-sentence-level-semantics,-textual-inference,-and-other-areas-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P1168","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77423/poster_document/bf863430df681861f17f658f9a89e040.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"On Isotropy, Contextualization and Learning Dynamics of Contrastive-based Sentence Representation Learning","tldr":"Incorporating contrastive learning objectives in sentence representation learning (SRL) has yielded significant improvements on many sentence-level NLP tasks.

Different from previous studies retrieving semantic similar neighbors, the ASTE task has its specialized challenges when adapting, i.e., the purpose includes predicting the sentiment polarity and it is usually aspect-dependent. Semantic similar neighbors with different polarities will be infeasible even counterproductive. To tackle this issue, we propose a  retrieval-based neural ASTE approach, named RLI (Retrieval-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction via Label Interpolation), which exploits the label information of neighbors. Given an aspect-opinion term pair, we retrieve semantic similar triplets from the training corpus and interpolate their label information into the augmented representation of the target pair. The retriever is jointly trained with the whole ASTE framework, and neighbors with both similar semantics and sentiments can be recalled with the aid of this distant supervision. In addition, we design a simple yet effective pre-train method for the retriever that implicitly encodes the label similarities. Extensive experiments and analysis on two widely-used benchmarks show that the proposed model establishes a new state-of-the-art on ASTE.","authors":["GuoxinYu","LemaoLiu","HaiyunJiang","ShumingShi","XiangAo"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-sentiment-analysis,-stylistic-analysis,-and-argument-mining-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1190","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Making Better Use of Training Corpus: Retrieval-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction via Label Interpolation","tldr":"In this paper, we aim to adapt the idea of retrieval-based neural approaches \nto the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) task.

Classification focuses on identifying intents beyond the predefined set of the dialog system, but it will not further differentiate detected OOD intents in fine granularity. Discovering focuses on how to cluster unlabeled samples according to their semantic representation, which relies heavily on prior knowledge and can not provide label information for the formed clusters. To be closer to the real user-facing scenarios, we introduce a task paradigm to extend Classification with Discovering referred as Open Environment Intent Prediction, which is to make a further fine-grained discovery of OOD based on OOD Intent Classification. Using various widely-used generative models as an archetype, we propose a general scheme for Open Environment Intent Prediction. In a nutshell, we first perform intent detection to identify the In-domain (IND) samples and then generate labels for those identified as OOD. With these generated labels, we can discover new general intents and provide label information for them. We develop a suite of benchmarks on the existing intent datasets and present a simple yet effective implementation.

Early attempts at document simplification merely applied these approaches iteratively over the sentences of a document. However, this fails to coherently preserve the discourse structure, leading to suboptimal output quality. Recently, strategies from controllable simplification have been leveraged to achieve state-of-the-art results on document simplification by first generating a document-level plan (a sequence of sentence-level simplification operations) and using this plan to guide sentence-level simplification downstream. However, this is still limited in that the simplification model has no direct access to the local inter-sentence document context, likely having a negative impact on surface realisation. We explore various systems that use document context within the simplification process itself, either by iterating over larger text units or by extending the system architecture to attend over a high-level representation of document context. In doing so, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the document simplification task, even when not relying on plan-guidance. Further, we investigate the performance and efficiency tradeoffs of system variants and make suggestions of when each should be preferred.","authors":["LiamCripwell","Jo\u00eblLegrand","ClaireGardent"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1228","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77432/poster_document/641060104ed26a1784ae9452ff8d3c6a.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Context-Aware Document Simplification","tldr":"To date, most work on text simplification has focused on sentence-level inputs.

Specifically, our benchmark involves comparing the scores an LLM assigns to a factually consistent versus a factually inconsistent summary for an input news article. For factually consistent summaries, we use human-written reference summaries that we manually verify as factually consistent. To generate summaries that are factually inconsistent, we generate summaries from a suite of summarization models that we have manually annotated as factually inconsistent.

ICD coding is a challenging multilabel text classification problem due to noisy clinical document inputs and long-tailed label distribution. Recent automated ICD coding efforts improve performance by encoding medical notes and codes with additional data and knowledge bases. However, most of them do not reflect how human coders generate the code: first, the coders select general code categories and then look for specific subcategories that are relevant to a patient's condition. Inspired by this, we propose a two-stage decoding mechanism to predict ICD codes. Our model uses the hierarchical properties of the codes to split the prediction into two steps: At first, we predict the parent code and then predict the child code based on the previous prediction. Experiments on the public MIMIC-III data set have shown that our model performs well in single-model settings without external data or knowledge.","authors":["Thanh-TungNguyen","ViktorSchlegel","AbhinavRamesh Kashyap","StefanWinkler"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1411","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"A Two-Stage Decoder for Efficient ICD Coding","tldr":"Clinical notes in healthcare facilities are tagged with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code; a list of classification codes for medical diagnoses and procedures.

This paper extensively studies UE on the benchmark designed for WSD.

Then, we examine the capability of capturing data and model uncertainties by the model with the selected UE score on well-designed test scenarios and discover that the model reflects data uncertainty satisfactorily but underestimates model uncertainty. Furthermore, we explore numerous lexical properties that intrinsically affect data uncertainty and provide a detailed analysis of four critical aspects: the syntactic category, morphology, sense granularity, and semantic relations.","authors":["ZhuLiu","YingLiu"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-semantics_-lexical-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P1436","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Ambiguity Meets Uncertainty: Investigating Uncertainty Estimation for Word Sense Disambiguation","tldr":"Word sense disambiguation (WSD), which aims to determine an appropriate sense for a target word given its context, is crucial for natural language understanding.

Recently, end-to-end dialogue models pre-trained based on large datasets have shown promising performance in the conversational system. However, they share the same parameters to train tasks of the dialogue system (NLU, DST, NLG), so debugging each task is challenging. Also, they require a lot of effort to fine-tune large parameters to create a task-oriented chatbot, making it difficult for non-experts to handle. Therefore, we intend to train relatively lightweight and fast models compared to PLM. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end TOD system with Task-Optimized Adapters which learn independently per task, adding only small number of parameters after fixed layers of pre-trained network. We also enhance the performance of the DST and NLG modules through reinforcement learning, overcoming the learning curve that has lacked at the adapter learning and enabling the natural and consistent response generation that is appropriate for the goal. Our method is a model-agnostic approach and does not require prompt-tuning as only input data without a prompt. As results of the experiment, our method shows competitive performance on the MultiWOZ benchmark compared to the existing end-to-end models. In particular, we attain state-of-the-art performance on the DST task of 2.2 dataset.","authors":["NamoBang","JeehyunLee","Myoung-WanKoo"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1513","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Task-Optimized Adapters for an End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue System","tldr":"Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to carry out specific tasks by tracking dialogue states and generating appropriate responses to help users achieve defined goals.

Extensive experiments with multiple architectures including GPT-3 show that RoT dramatically improves LMs' inference capability to solve problems, whose solution consists of hundreds of thousands of tokens.","authors":["SoochanLee","GunheeKim"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P1583","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77499/poster_document/ce113b8c807c57bbf124219fbd0de48d.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Recursion of Thought: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Multi-Context Reasoning with Language Models","tldr":"Generating intermediate steps, or Chain of Thought (CoT), is an effective way to significantly improve language models' (LM) multi-step reasoning capability.

They are applied to datasets before training, so translation or text generation quality relies on the quality of segmentations. We propose a departure from this paradigm, called subword segmental machine translation (SSMT). SSMT unifies subword segmentation and MT in a single trainable model. It learns to segment target sentence words while jointly learning to generate target sentences. To use SSMT during inference we propose  dynamic decoding, a text generation algorithm that adapts segmentations as it generates translations. Experiments across 6 translation directions show that SSMT improves chrF scores for morphologically rich agglutinative languages. Gains are strongest in the very low-resource scenario. SSMT also learns subwords that are closer to morphemes compared to baselines and proves more robust on a test set constructed for evaluating morphological compositional generalisation.","authors":["FrancoisMeyer","JanBuys"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-phonology,-morphology,-and-word-segmentation-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P1621","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77506/poster_document/075d25a39cc8374d2af463d4e6be3ca3.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Subword Segmental Machine Translation: Unifying Segmentation and Target Sentence Generation","tldr":"Subword segmenters like BPE operate as a preprocessing step in neural machine translation and other (conditional) language models.

(2) function-based neuron grouping: we explore to find a structure that groups neurons into modules by function, and each module works for its corresponding function. Given the enormous amount of possible structures, we focus on Mixture-of-Experts as a promising candidate, which partitions neurons into experts and usually activates different experts for different inputs. Experimental results show that there are functional experts, where clustered are the neurons specialized in a certain function.

The class-level imbalanced distant annotation is a realistic and unexplored problem, and the popular method of self-training can not handle class-level imbalanced learning. More importantly, self-training is dominated by the high-performance class in selecting candidates, and deteriorates the low-performance class with the bias of generated pseudo label. To address the class-level imbalance performance, we propose a class-rebalancing self-training framework for improving the distantly-supervised named entity recognition. In candidate selection, a class-wise flexible threshold is designed to fully explore other classes besides the high-performance class. In label generation, injecting the distant label, a hybrid pseudo label is adopted to provide straight semantic information for the low-performance class. Experiments on five flat and two nested datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.

In this paper, we show that robust and non-robust instances in the training dataset, though are both important for test performance, have contrary impacts on robustness, which makes it possible to build a highly robust model by leveraging the training dataset in a more effective way. We propose a new method that can distinguish between robust instances from non-robust ones according to the model's sensitivity to perturbations on individual instances during training. Surprisingly, we find that the model under standard training easily overfits the robust instances by relying on their simple patterns before the model completely learns their robust features. Finally, we propose a new mitigation algorithm to further release the potential of robust instances.

The proposed method learns to assign importance masks for sub-structures of DNNs, and accordingly indicate the task-specific connectivity patterns.

This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than thousands of data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 29.4\\% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.","authors":["FangyuLiu","JulianMartinEisenschlos","FrancescoPiccinno","SyrineKrichene","ChenxiPang","KentonLee","MandarJoshi","WenhuChen","NigelCollier","YaseminAltun"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-east',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P2133","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77594/poster_document/614a2c2008b206bb4272620e33ca15a3.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"DePlot: One-shot visual language reasoning by plot-to-table translation","tldr":"Visual language such as charts and plots is ubiquitous in the human world.

Most existing AES systems assume to grade essays of the same prompt as used in training and assign only a holistic score. However, such settings conflict with real-education situations; pre-graded essays for a particular prompt are lacking, and detailed trait scores of sub-rubrics are required. Thus, predicting various trait scores of unseen-prompt essays (called cross-prompt essay trait scoring) is a remaining challenge of AES. In this paper, we propose a robust model: prompt- and trait relation-aware cross-prompt essay trait scorer. We encode prompt-aware essay representation by essay-prompt attention and utilizing the topic-coherence feature extracted by the topic-modeling mechanism without access to labeled data; therefore, our model considers the prompt adherence of an essay, even in a cross-prompt setting. To facilitate multi-trait scoring, we design trait-similarity loss that encapsulates the correlations of traits. Experiments prove the efficacy of our model, showing state-of-the-art results for all prompts and traits. Significant improvements in low-resource-prompt and inferior traits further indicate our model's strength.","authors":["HeejinDo","YunsuKim","Gary GeunbaeLee"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-nlp-applications-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-east',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P2187","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77600/poster_document/ab0422d816ceed25f1cf254cc138b2e2.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Prompt- and Trait Relation-aware Cross-prompt Essay Trait Scoring","tldr":"Automated essay scoring (AES) aims to score essays written for a given prompt, which defines the writing topic.

Most existing attacks rely on the observation that models tend to\nassign higher probabilities to their training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding of the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as it does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has demonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those obtained from a reference model trained on similar \ndata can substantially improve the performance of MIAs.\nHowever, in order to train reference models, attacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training data. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios and find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used to train reference models. To investigate whether this fragility provides a layer of safety, we propose and evaluate neighbourhood attacks, which compare model scores for a given sample to scores of synthetically generated neighbour texts and therefore eliminate the need for access to the training data distribution. We show that, in addition to being competitive with reference-based attacks that have perfect knowledge about the training data distribution, our attack clearly outperforms existing reference-free attacks as well as reference-based attacks with imperfect knowledge, which demonstrates the need for a reevaluation of the threat model of adversarial attacks.","authors":["JustusMattern","FatemehsadatMireshghallah","ZhijingJin","BernhardSchoelkopf","MrinmayaSachan","TaylorBerg-Kirkpatrick"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P2197","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Membership Inference Attacks against Language Models via Neighbourhood Comparison","tldr":"Membership Inference attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample was present in the training data of a machine learning model or not, and are widely used for assessing the privacy risks of lan...","track":"Large Language Models","underline_id":77602,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77602-membership-inference-attacks-against-language-models-via-neighbourhood-comparison","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in learning from expla- nations in prompts, but there has been limited understanding of exactly how these explana- tions function or why they are effective.

By per- turbing explanations on three controlled tasks, we show that both factors contribute to the ef- fectiveness of explanations.

The tenor and the vehicle are usually connected with comparator words such as \"like\" or \"as\". The simile phenomena are unique and complex in a real-life dialogue scene where the tenor and the vehicle can be verbal phrases or sentences, mentioned by different speakers, exist in different sentences, or occur in reversed order. However, the current simile research usually focuses on similes in a triplet tuple (tenor, property, vehicle) or a single sentence where the tenor and vehicle are usually entities or noun phrases, which could not reflect complex simile phenomena in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel and high-quality multilingual simile dialogue (MSD) dataset to facilitate the study of complex simile phenomena. The MSD is the largest manually annotated simile data ($\\sim$21K) and it contains both English and Chinese data. Meanwhile, the MSD data can also be used on dialogue tasks to test the ability of dialogue systems when using similes. We design 3 simile tasks (recognition, interpretation, and generation) and 2 dialogue tasks (retrieval and generation) with MSD. For each task, we provide experimental results from strong pre-trained or state-of-the-art models.

Having a more balanced benchmark (DLAMA-v1) supports that mBERT performs better on Western facts than non-Western ones, while monolingual Arabic, English, and Korean models tend to perform better on their culturally proximate facts.

Experiments on three semantically diverse generation tasks show that our method reduces the accidental translation problem by 68\\% and improves the ROUGE-L score by 1.5 on average.","authors":["TianjianLi","KentonMurray"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P2288","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Why Does Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Generation Fail?

To build a system that can quickly and easily generalize to new tasks, task instructions have been adopted as an emerging trend of supervision recently. These instructions give the model the definition of the task and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the instructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in different forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some instructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM) oriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are human-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very likely explain the same task with instructions of different textual expressions. A robust system for task generalization should be able to handle any new tasks regardless of the variability of instructions.  \n\nHowever, the system robustness in dealing with instruction-driven task generalization is still unexplored.

Despite the convincing performance, ELECTRA still faces the challenges of monotonous training and deficient interaction. Generator with only masked language modeling (MLM) leads to biased learning and label imbalance for discriminator, decreasing learning efficiency; no explicit feedback loop from discriminator to generator results in the chasm between these two components, underutilizing the course learning. In this study, a multi-perspective course learning (MCL) method is proposed to fetch a many degrees and visual angles for sample-efficient pre-training, and to fully leverage the relationship between generator and discriminator. Concretely, three self-supervision courses are designed to alleviate inherent flaws of MLM and balance the label in a multi-perspective way. Besides, two self-correction courses are proposed to bridge the chasm between the two encoders by creating a \"correction notebook\" for secondary-supervision.

Currently, there are two popular approaches to make use of the unlabelled data: Self-training (ST) and Task-adaptive pre-training (TAPT). ST uses a teacher model to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled data, while TAPT continues pre-training on the unlabelled data before fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, the effectiveness of TAPT in SSL tasks has not been systematically studied, and no previous work has directly compared TAPT and ST in terms of their ability to utilize the pool of unlabelled data. In this paper, we provide an extensive empirical study comparing five state-of-the-art ST approaches and TAPT across various NLP tasks and data sizes, including in- and out-of domain settings. Surprisingly, we find that TAPT is a strong and more robust SSL learner, even when using just a few hundred unlabelled samples or in the presence of domain shifts, compared to more sophisticated ST approaches, and tends to bring greater improvements in SSL than in fully-supervised settings. \nOur further analysis demonstrates the risks of using ST approaches when the size of labelled or unlabelled data is small or when domain shifts exist, and highlights TAPT as a potential solution.","authors":["ZhengxiangShi","FrancescoTonolini","NikolaosAletras","EmineYilmaz","GabriellaKazai","YunlongJiao"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P273","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77288/poster_document/e35d276644bbcb4406bc747b1ef16ece.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Rethinking Semi-supervised Learning with Language Models","tldr":"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular setting aiming to effectively utilize unlabelled data to improve model performance in downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

We perform basic sentence-final insertion and deletion perturbation tests with full stops, exclamation and questions marks across source languages and demonstrate a concerning finding: commercial, production-level machine translation systems are vulnerable to mere single punctuation insertion or deletion, resulting in unreliable translations. Moreover, we demonstrate that both string-based and model-based evaluation metrics also suffer from this vulnerability, producing significantly different scores when translations only differ in a single punctuation, with model-based metrics penalizing each punctuation differently. Our work calls into question the reliability of machine translation systems and their evaluation metrics, particularly for real-world use cases, where inconsistent punctuation is often the most common and the least disruptive noise.","authors":["PrathyushaJwalapuram"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-theme_-reality-check-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P2876","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77715/poster_document/b3c1319076e4d7b860483b452ab9a7ba.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77715/poster/7744a5c34cf3d9129682693d681b01c6.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Pulling Out All The Full Stops: Punctuation Sensitivity in Neural Machine Translation and Evaluation","tldr":"Much of the work testing machine translation systems for robustness and sensitivity has been adversarial or tended towards testing noisy input such as spelling errors, or non-standard input such as di...","track":"Theme: Reality Check","underline_id":77715,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77715-pulling-out-all-the-full-stops-punctuation-sensitivity-in-neural-machine-translation-and-evaluation","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52042/file/41023336701dcb96fe88367b4083d29a.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085053Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=566c64708148b4db00118884d6bacf1717884645862903a2c6bdf550ef9acd7d"},{"abstract":"The nodes in the commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) are normally represented by free-form short text (e.g., word or phrase). Different nodes may represent the same concept. This leads to the problems of edge sparsity and node redundancy, which challenges CSKG representation and completion. On the one hand, edge sparsity limits the performance of graph representation learning; On the other hand, node redundancy makes different nodes corresponding to the same concept have inconsistent relations with other nodes. To address the two problems, we propose a new CSKG completion framework based on Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering (CPNC). Contrastive Pretraining constructs positive and negative head-tail node pairs on CSKG and utilizes contrastive learning to obtain better semantic node representation. Node Clustering aggregates nodes with the same concept into a latent concept, assisting the task of CSKG completion. We evaluate our CPNC approach on two CSKG completion benchmarks (CN-100K and ATOMIC), where CPNC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both Contrastive Pretraining and Node Clustering can significantly improve the performance of CSKG completion.

With DUB, the back-translation technique can successfully be applied on direct ST and obtains an average boost of 5.5 BLEU on MuST-C En-De/Fr/Es. In the low-resource language scenario, our method achieves comparable performance to existing methods that rely on large-scale external data.

COCKATIEL is a novel, post-hoc, concept-based, model-agnostic XAI technique that generates meaningful explanations from the last layer of a neural net model trained on an NLP classification task by using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to discover the concepts the model leverages to make predictions and by exploiting a Sensitivity Analysis to estimate accurately the importance of each of these concepts for the model. It does so without compromising the accuracy of the underlying model or requiring a new one to be trained. \n\nWe conduct experiments in single and multi-aspect sentiment analysis tasks and we show COCKATIEL's superior ability to discover concepts that align with humans' on Transformer models without any supervision, we objectively verify the faithfulness of its explanations through fidelity metrics, and we showcase its ability to provide meaningful explanations in two different datasets.\n\nOur code is freely available: https://github.com/fanny-jourdan/cockatiel","authors":["FannyJourdan","AgustinMartinPicard","ThomasFel","LaurentRisser","Jean-MichelLoubes","NicholasAsher"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P3035","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77737/poster_document/32e4771b14bac9ac05101f0ee9f813cd.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"COCKATIEL: COntinuous Concept ranKed ATtribution with Interpretable ELements for explaining neural net classifiers on NLP","tldr":"Transformer architectures are complex and their use in NLP, while it has engendered many successes, makes their interpretability or explainability challenging.

In this work, we aim to understand the properties of good in-context examples for MT in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. We show that the translation quality and the domain of the in-context examples matter and that 1-shot noisy unrelated examples can have a catastrophic impact on output quality. While concatenating multiple random examples reduces the effect of noise, a single good prompt optimized to maximize translation quality on the development dataset can elicit learned information from the pre-trained language model.

One common way to improve this transfer is to perform realignment steps before fine-tuning, i.e., to train the model to build similar representations for pairs of words from translated sentences. But such realignment methods were found to not always improve results across languages and tasks, which raises the question of whether aligned representations are truly beneficial for cross-lingual transfer. We provide evidence that alignment is actually significantly correlated with cross-lingual transfer across languages, models and random seeds. We show that fine-tuning can have a significant impact on alignment, depending mainly on the downstream task and the model. Finally, we show that realignment can, in some instances, improve cross-lingual transfer, and we identify conditions in which realignment methods provide significant improvements. Namely, we find that realignment works better on tasks for which alignment is correlated with cross-lingual transfer when generalizing to a distant language and with smaller models, as well as when using a bilingual dictionary rather than FastAlign to extract realignment pairs. For example, for POS-tagging, between English and Arabic, realignment can bring a +15.8 accuracy improvement on distilmBERT, even outperforming XLM-R Large by 1.7. We thus advocate for further research on realignment methods for smaller multilingual models as an alternative to scaling.","authors":["FelixGaschi","PatricioCerda","ParisaRastin","YannickToussaint"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-multilingualism-and-cross-lingual-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3047","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77738/poster_document/38e9f106fd55cf60bc012daf26b0321b.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77738/poster/0aa6e3e77b0072c4b562c332638fd539.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Exploring the Relationship between Alignment and Cross-lingual Transfer in Multilingual Transformers","tldr":"Without any explicit cross-lingual training data, multilingual language models can achieve cross-lingual transfer.

Encouragingly, the gains are especially pronounced for distant languages (up to 2x absolute gain). We further show that our approach is robust towards the ratio of code-switched tokens and also extends to unseen languages.

While most existing work addresses a particular IE task, universally modeling various IE tasks with one model has achieved great success recently. Despite their success, they employ a one-stage learning strategy, i.e., directly learning to extract the target structure given the input text, which contradicts the human learning process. In this paper, we propose a unified easy-to-hard learning framework consisting of three stages, i.e., the easy stage, the hard stage, and the main stage, for IE by mimicking the human learning process. By breaking down the learning process into multiple stages, our framework facilitates the model to acquire general IE task knowledge and improve its generalization ability.  Extensive experiments across four IE tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Common in-processing bias mitigation approaches, such as adversarial training and mutual information removal, introduce additional optimization criteria, and update the model to reach a new debiased state. However, in practice, end-users and practitioners might prefer to switch back to the original model, or apply debiasing only on a specific subset of protected attributes. To enable this, we propose a novel modular bias mitigation approach, consisting of stand-alone highly sparse debiasing subnetworks, where each debiasing module can be integrated into the core model on-demand at inference time. Our approach draws from the concept of diff pruning, and proposes a novel training regime adaptable to various representation disentanglement optimizations. We conduct experiments on three classification tasks with gender, race, and age as protected attributes. The results show that our modular approach, while maintaining task performance, improves (or at least remains on-par with) the effectiveness of bias mitigation in comparison with baseline finetuning. Particularly on a two-attribute dataset, our approach with separately learned debiasing subnetworks shows effective utilization of either or both the subnetworks for selective bias mitigation.","authors":["LukasHauzenberger","ShahedMasoudian","DeepakKumar","MarkusSchedl","NavidRekabsaz"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-ethics-and-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3150","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Modular and On-demand Bias Mitigation with Attribute-Removal Subnetworks","tldr":"Societal biases are reflected in large pre-trained language models and their fine-tuned versions on downstream tasks.

Existing research has primarily focused on providing individual, well-defined types of context in translation, such as the surrounding text or discrete external variables like the speaker's gender. This work introduces MTCue, a novel neural machine translation (NMT) framework that interprets all context (including discrete variables) as text. MTCue learns an abstract representation of context, enabling transferability across different data settings and leveraging similar attributes in low-resource scenarios. With a focus on a dialogue domain with access to document and metadata context, we extensively evaluate MTCue in four language pairs in both translation directions. Our framework demonstrates significant improvements in translation quality over a parameter-matched non-contextual baseline, as measured by BLEU (+0.88) and Comet (+1.58). Moreover, MTCue significantly outperforms a \"tagging\" baseline at translating English text. Analysis reveals that the context encoder of MTCue learns a representation space that organises context based on specific attributes, such as formality, enabling effective zero-shot control. Pre-training on context embeddings also improves MTCue's few-shot performance compared to the \"tagging\" baseline. Finally, an ablation study conducted on model components and contextual variables further supports the robustness of MTCue for context-based NMT.","authors":["SebastianT.Vincent","RobertJamesFlynn","CarolinaScarton"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-translation-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P3152","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77755/poster_document/d026d10066005b16f4cdf60e63d5bf97.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"MTCue: Learning Zero-Shot Control of Extra-Textual Attributes by Leveraging Unstructured Context in Neural Machine Translation","tldr":"Efficient utilisation of both intra- and extra-textual context remains one of the critical gaps between machine and human translation.

Extensive experiments on six WMT benchmarks over two advanced NAT models show that scaling can alleviate the commonly-cited weaknesses of NAT models, resulting in better translation performance. To reduce the side-effect of scaling on decoding speed, we empirically investigate the impact of NAT encoder and decoder on the translation performance. Experimental results on the large-scale WMT20 En-De show that the asymmetric architecture (e.g. bigger encoder and smaller decoder) can achieve comparable performance with the scaling model, while maintaining the superiority of decoding speed with standard NAT models. To this end, we establish a new benchmark by validating scaled NAT models on the scaled dataset, which can be regarded as a strong baseline for future works.

Many deep learning algorithms rely on weight decay, dropout, batch/layer normalization to converge faster and generalize. Label Smoothing (LS) is another simple, versatile and efficient regularization which can be applied to various supervised classification tasks. Conventional LS, however, regardless of the training instance assumes that each non-target class is equally likely.\nIn this work, we present a general framework for training with label regularization, which includes conventional LS but can also model instance-specific variants. Based on this formulation, we propose an efficient way of learning LAbel regularization by devising a Bi-level Optimization (LABO) problem. We derive a deterministic and interpretable solution of the inner loop as the optimal label smoothing without the need to store the parameters or the output of a trained model. \nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate our LABO consistently yields improvement over conventional label regularization on various fields, including seven machine translation and three image classification tasks across various neural network architectures while maintaining training efficiency.","authors":["PengLu","AhmadRashid","IvanKobyzev","MehdiRezagholizadeh","PhillippeLanglais"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P331","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"LABO: Towards Learning Optimal Label Regularization via Bi-level Optimization","tldr":"Regularization techniques are crucial to improving the generalization performance and training efficiency of deep neural networks.

In contrast, we analyze the effect those variables have on the performance of language models in constrained settings, by building three lightweight BERT models (16M/51M/124M parameters) trained over a set of small corpora (5M/25M/125M words).\nWe experiment on four languages of different linguistic characteristics (Basque, Spanish, Swahili and Finnish), and evaluate the models on MLM and several NLU tasks. We conclude that the power laws for parameters, data and compute for low-resource settings differ from the optimal scaling laws previously inferred, and data requirements should be higher. Our insights are consistent across all the languages we study, as well as across the MLM and downstream tasks.

Despite the remarkable performance gained on In-Distribution (ID) datasets,  the VQA model might merely capture the superficial correlation from question to answer rather than showing real reasoning abilities. Therefore, when switching to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) dataset, whose test distribution is unknown or even reversed with the training set, significant drops might be demonstrated.\nAlthough efforts have been devoted to easing the negative bias effect brought by language prior and analysing its  inherent cause, they are still limited by the following two aspects. First, most current debiasing methods achieve promising OOD generalization ability with a major sacrifice of the ID performance. Second, existing researches are restricted by exploiting comprehensive biases, since weakening the language bias is mainly focused, while only a few works consider vision bias. In this paper, we investigate a straightforward way to mitigate bias problem for VQA task. Specifically, we reduce bias effect by subtracting bias score from standard VQA base score. Based on such a direct strategy, we design two bias learning branches to detect more bias information, which are combined with a dynamical constraint loss to alleviate the problem of over-correction and insufficient debiasing effect.

A significant challenge for automatic radiology report generation is that the radiology reports are long narratives consisting of multiple sentences for both abnormal and normal findings. Therefore, applying conventional image captioning approaches to generate the whole report proves to be insufficient, as these are designed to briefly describe images with short sentences. We propose a template-based approach to generate radiology reports from radiographs. Our approach involves the following: i) using a multilabel image classifier, produce the tags for the input radiograph; ii) using a transformer-based model, generate pathological descriptions (a description of abnormal findings seen on radiographs) from the tags generated in step (i); iii) using a BERT-based multi-label text classifier, find the spans in the normal report template to replace with the generated pathological descriptions; and iv) using a rule-based system, replace the identified span with the generated pathological description. We performed experiments with the two most popular radiology report datasets, IU Chest X-ray and MIMIC-CXR and demonstrated that the BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr scores are better than the State-of-the-Art models by 25\\%, 36\\%, 44\\% and 48\\% respectively, on the IU X-RAY dataset.

Echoes features\nthree novel datasets: i) Echo-Wiki, for multilingual book summarization, ii) Echo-XSum, for extremely-compressive multilingual book summarization, and iii) Echo-FairySum, for extractive book summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Echoes \u2013 with its thousands of books and summaries \u2013 is the largest resource, and the first to be multilingual, featuring 5 languages and 25 language pairs. In addition to Echoes, we also introduce a new extractive-then-abstractive baseline, and, supported by our experimental results and manual analysis of the summaries generated, we argue that this baseline is more suitable for book summarization than purely-abstractive approaches. We release our resource and software at https://github.com/Babelscape/echoes-from-alexandria in the hope of fostering innovative research in multilingual book\nsummarization.","authors":["AlessandroScir\u00e8","SimoneConia","SimoneCiciliano","RobertoNavigli"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-resources-and-evaluation-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-east',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P3630","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77834/poster_document/e49385ab8c09b0a4879bc9feb95cb714.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Echoes from Alexandria: A Large Resource for Multilingual Book Summarization","tldr":"In recent years, research in text summarization has mainly focused on the news domain, where texts are typically short and have strong layout features.

As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context whenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's memorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the context, which then facilitates updating specific model predictions without frequently retraining the model. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the task, the model should ignore it and fall back on its internal knowledge. In this paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two properties, namely controllability and robustness, in the context of LLMs. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art T5 and PaLM models (both pretrained and finetuned) could exhibit low controllability and robustness that does not improve with increasing the model size. As a solution, we propose a simple yet effective method \u2013 knowledge aware finetuning (KAFT) \u2013 to strengthen both controllability and robustness by injecting counterfactual and irrelevant contexts to standard supervised datasets.

Our contributions are twofold: first, we show that the learning algorithm used to imitate is crucial: supervised learning tends to produce more average languages, while reinforcement learning introduces a selection pressure toward more compositional languages. \nSecond, our study reveals that compositional languages are easier to imitate, which may induce the pressure toward compositional languages in RL imitation settings.","authors":["EmilyCheng","MathieuRita","ThierryPoibeau"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-dialogue-and-interactive-systems-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P3788","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"On the Correspondence between Compositionality and Imitation in Emergent Neural Communication","tldr":"Compositionality is a hallmark of human language that not only enables linguistic generalization, but also potentially facilitates acquisition.

To shore up this deficiency, we propose a novel framework that integrates both speech and text features to enhance GEC. In detail, we create new multimodal GEC datasets for English and German by generating audio from text using the advanced text-to-speech models.

A mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer is employed to selectively align representations from the two modalities, and then a dot attention mechanism is used to fuse them as final multimodal representations.

For tasks that involve span-level annotations, such as information extraction or question answering, an additional label projection step is required to map annotated spans onto the translated texts. Recently, a few efforts have utilized a simple mark-then-translate method to jointly perform translation and projection  by inserting special markers around the labeled spans in the original sentence. However, as far as we are aware, no empirical analysis has been conducted on how this approach compares to traditional annotation projection based on word alignment. In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study across 57 languages and three  tasks (QA, NER, and Event Extraction) to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of both methods, filling an important gap in the literature.  Experimental results show that our optimized version of mark-then-translate, which we call EasyProject,  is easily applied to many languages and works surprisingly well, outperforming the more complex word alignment-based methods. We analyze several key factors that affect the end-task performance, and show  EasyProject works well because it can accurately preserve label span boundaries after translation.

Second, it penalises valid questions that may not have high lexical or semantic similarity to the reference questions.

Recently, Wortsman et al.

They prevent forgetting as the network weights are not being updated. Although there is no forgetting, the performance of SupSup is sub-optimal because fixed weights restrict its representational power. Furthermore, there is no accumulation or transfer of knowledge inside the model when new tasks are learned. Hence, we propose ExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNetwork Training), that performs exclusive and non-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This avoids conflicting updates to the shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve performance while still preventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel KNN-based Knowledge Transfer (KKT) module that utilizes previously acquired knowledge to learn new tasks better and faster. We demonstrate that ExSSNeT outperforms strong previous methods on both NLP and Vision domains while preventing forgetting. Moreover, ExSSNeT is particularly advantageous for sparse masks that activate 2-10\\% of the model parameters, resulting in an average improvement of 8.3\\% over SupSup.

To address this problem, we introduce a new dataset for social bias detection in Hindi and investigate multilingual transfer learning using publicly available English, Italian, and Korean datasets. The Hindi dataset contains ~ 9k social media posts annotated for (i) binary bias labels (bias/neutral), (ii) binary labels for sentiment (positive/negative), (iii) target groups for each bias category, and (iv) rationale for annotated bias labels (a short piece of text). We benchmark our Hindi dataset using different multilingual models, with XLM-R achieving the best performance of 80.8 macro-F1 score. Our results show that the detection of social biases in resource-constrained languages such as Hindi and Korean may be improved with the use of a similar dataset in English.

Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.","authors":["XianmingLi","ZongxiLi","XiaotianLuo","HaoranXie","XingLee","YingbinZhao","Fu LeeWang","QingLi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-information-retrieval-and-text-mining-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-east',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P406","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling","tldr":"Self-attention-based models have achieved remarkable progress in short-text mining.

Prior research on the representational capabilities of LLMs evaluates whether they show human-level performance, for instance, high overall accuracy on standard benchmarks. Here, we ask a different question, one inspired by cognitive science: How closely do the number representations of LLMscorrespond to those of human language users, who typically demonstrate the distance, size, and ratio effects? We depend on a linking hypothesis to map the similarities among the model embeddings of number words and digits to human response times. The results reveal surprisingly human-like representations across language models of different architectures, despite the absence of the neural circuitry that directly supports these representations in the human brain.

Existing approaches to automatically detect metaphor and hyperbole have studied these language phenomena independently, but their relationship has hardly, if ever, been explored computationally. In this paper, we propose a multi-task deep learning framework to detect hyperbole and metaphor simultaneously. We hypothesize that metaphors help in hyperbole detection, and vice-versa. To test this hypothesis, we annotate two hyperbole datasets- HYPO and HYPO-L- with metaphor labels. Simultaneously, we annotate two metaphor datasets- TroFi and LCC- with hyperbole labels.

We propose several novel approaches to pre-training translation models that involve different levels of lexical and structural knowledge, including: 1) generating obfuscated data from a large parallel corpus 2) concatenating phrase pairs extracted from a small word-aligned corpus, and 3) generating synthetic parallel data without real human language corpora. Our experiments on multiple language pairs reveal that pre-training benefits can be realized even with high levels of obfuscation or purely synthetic parallel data.

We then estimate the prevalence of these discipline-specific words and senses across hundreds of subfields, and show that word senses provide a complementary, yet unique view of jargon alongside word types. We demonstrate the utility of our metrics for science of science and computational sociolinguistics by highlighting two key social implications. First, though most fields reduce their use of jargon when writing for general-purpose venues, and some fields (e.g., biological sciences) do so less than others. Second, the direction of correlation between jargon and citation rates varies among fields, but jargon is nearly always negatively correlated with interdisciplinary impact. Broadly, our findings suggest that though multidisciplinary venues intend to cater to more general audiences, some fields' writing norms may act as barriers rather than bridges, and thus impede the dispersion of scholarly ideas.","authors":["LiLucy","JesseDodge","DavidBamman","KatherineA.Keith"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-computational-social-science-and-cultural-analytics-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-east',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4135","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77915/poster_document/d373d732172467c77d79d6eb83b23ae9.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77915/poster/4777e9ea1ea1440106a9df7b4e9704c7.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Words as Gatekeepers: Measuring Discipline-specific Terms and Meanings in Scholarly Publications","tldr":"Scholarly text is often laden with jargon, or specialized language that can facilitate efficient in-group communication within fields but hinder understanding for out-groups.

We take inspiration from cognitive science studies dealing with children's language learning to propose a curriculum learning framework. The learning begins with easy-to-align image caption pairs containing one concept per caption. The difficulty is progressively increased with each new phase by adding one more concept per caption. Correspondingly, the knowledge acquired in each learning phase is utilized in subsequent phases to effectively constrain the learning problem to aligning one new concept-object pair in each phase. We show that this learning strategy improves over vanilla image-caption training in various settings -- pretraining from scratch, using a pretrained image or/and pretrained text encoder, low data regime etc.","authors":["HammadAyyubi","RahulLokesh","AlirezaZareian","BoWu","Shih-FuChang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-language-grounding-to-vision,-robotics,-and-beyond-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4140","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77916/poster_document/b1581223cdbae88419b2cb84b3f0fdb1.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77916/poster/8ec72251de7eadb0205f723dff529650.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Learning from Children: Improving Image-Caption Pretraining via Curriculum","tldr":"Image-caption pretraining has been quite successfully used for downstream vision tasks like zero-shot image classification and object detection.

However, in real-world scenarios, TKG data is often received incrementally as events unfold, leading to a dynamic non-stationary data distribution over time. While one could incorporate fine-tuning to existing methods to allow them to adapt to evolving TKG data, this can lead to forgetting previously learned patterns. Alternatively, retraining the model with the entire updated TKG can mitigate forgetting but is computationally burdensome. To address these challenges, we propose a general continual training framework that is applicable to any TKG completion method, and leverages two key ideas: (i) a temporal regularization that encourages repurposing of less important model parameters for learning new knowledge, and (ii) a clustering-based experience replay that reinforces the past knowledge by selectively preserving only a small portion of the past data. Our experimental results on widely used event-centric TKG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed continual training framework in adapting to new events while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Further, we perform ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each component of our proposed framework. Finally, we investigate the relation between the memory dedicated to experience replay and the benefit gained from our clustering-based sampling strategy.","authors":["MehrnooshMirtaheri","MohammadRostami","AramGalstyan"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4371","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"History repeats: Overcoming catastrophic forgetting for event-centric temporal knowledge graph completion","tldr":"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) completion models typically rely on having access to the entire graph during training.

When learning classes incrementally, the classifier must be constantly updated to incorporate new classes, and the drift in decision boundary may lead to severe forgetting. This fundamental challenge, however, has not yet been studied extensively, especially in the setting where no samples from old classes are stored for rehearsal. In this paper, we take a closer look at how the drift in the classifier leads to forgetting, and accordingly, design four simple yet (super-) effective solutions to alleviate the classifier drift: an Individual Classifiers with Frozen Feature Extractor (ICE) framework where we individually train a classifier for each learning session, and its three variants ICE-PL, ICE-O, and ICE-PL\\&O which further take the logits of previously learned classes from old sessions or a constant logit of an Other class as constraint to the learning of new classifiers. Extensive experiments and analysis on 6 class-incremental information extraction tasks demonstrate that our solutions, especially ICE-O, consistently show significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approaches with up to 44.7\\% absolute F-score gain, providing a strong baseline and insights for future research on class-incremental learning.","authors":["MinqianLiu","LifuHuang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-information-extraction-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4519","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77962/poster_document/9058ec49aa5bf29d241e309b211f4c0b.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77962/poster/6ad213bdc612ab97cb3c12607690d154.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Teamwork Is Not Always Good: An Empirical Study of Classifier Drift in Class-incremental Information Extraction","tldr":"Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to develop a learning system that can continually learn new classes from a data stream without forgetting previously learned classes.

Visual document classifiers have shown impressive performance on in-distribution test sets. However, they tend to have a hard time correctly classifying and differentiating out-of-distribution examples. Image-based classifiers lack the text component, whereas multi-modality transformer-based models face the token serialization problem in visual documents due to their diverse layouts. They also require a lot of computing power during inference, making them impractical for many real-world applications.

Recent work has demonstrated that dense hierarchical retrieval (DHR), which retrieves document candidates first and then relevant passages from the refined document set, can significantly outperform the single stage dense passage retriever (DPR). While effective, this approach requires document structure information to learn document representation and is hard to adopt to other domains without this information. Additionally, the dense retrievers tend to generalize poorly on out-of-domain data comparing with sparse retrievers such as BM25. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Hierarchical Retrieval (HHR) to address the existing limitations.

However, FCNNs have been shown to perform inefficient splitting for review features, making the model difficult to clearly differentiate helpful from unhelpful reviews. Furthermore, pairwise objective, which works on review pairs, may not completely capture the MRHP goal to produce the ranking for the entire review list, and possibly induces low generalization during testing.

However, current geometric-based methods depend on the neural approach to model FOL operators (conjunction, disjunction and negation), which are not easily explainable with considerable computation cost. We overcome this challenge by introducing a symbolic modeling approach for the FOL operators, emphasizing the direct calculation of the intersection between geometric shapes, particularly sector-cones in the embedding space, to model the conjunction operator. This approach reduces the computation cost as a non-neural approach is involved in the core logic operators. Moreover, we propose to accelerate the learning in the relation projection operator using the neural approach to emphasize the essential role of this operator in all query structures. Although empirical evidence for explainability is challenging, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in answering complex logical queries (both non-negative and negative FOL forms) over previous geometric-based models.","authors":["ChauDuc MinhNguyen","TimN.French","WeiLiu","MichaelStewart"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-question-answering-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P4704","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77985/poster_document/dde5b662062c040e1467773caaee1caa.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77985/poster/3353d52322b88731839d21e0e1b85dee.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"SConE: Simplified Cone Embeddings with Symbolic Operators for Complex Logical Queries","tldr":"Geometric representation of query embeddings (using points, particles, rectangles and cones) can effectively achieve the task of answering complex logical queries expressed in first-order logic (FOL) ...","track":"Question Answering","underline_id":77985,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77985-scone-simplified-cone-embeddings-with-symbolic-operators-for-complex-logical-queries","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52178/file/57d987f6091a17472ffdedfd378611e3.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085055Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a7bde89339e569926e939e82bf928cfcbfa3302e9f50a869780d48f650f233d5"},{"abstract":"There has been significant interest in zero and few-shot learning for dialogue state tracking (DST) due to the\u00a0high cost of collecting and annotating task-oriented dialogues.

We aim at closing this gap by investigating the types of noise encountered within a pipeline for truly unsupervised morphological paradigm completion and its impact on morphological inflection systems: First, we propose an error taxonomy and annotation pipeline for inflection training data. Then, we compare the effect of different types of noise on multiple state-of-the- art inflection models. Finally, we propose a novel character-level masked language modeling (CMLM) pretraining objective and explore its impact on the models' resistance to noise. Our experiments show that various architectures are impacted differently by separate types of noise, but encoder-decoders tend to be more robust to noise than models trained with a copy bias.

Recent work (e.g., Kim et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2021a) has achieved advances in unsupervised induction of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). However, categorial grammar induction has received less recent attention, despite allowing inducers to support a larger set of syntactic categories\u2014due to restrictions on how categories can combine\u2014and providing a transparent interface with compositional semantics, opening up possibilities for models that jointly learn form and meaning. Motivated by this, we propose a new model for inducing a basic (Ajdukiewicz, 1935; Bar-Hillel, 1953) categorial grammar. In contrast to earlier categorial grammar induction systems (e.g., Bisk and Hockenmaier, 2012), our model learns from raw data without any part-of-speech information. Experiments on child-directed speech show that our model attains a recall-homogeneity of 0.33 on average, which dramatically increases to 0.59 when a bias toward forward function application is added to the model.","authors":["ChristianClark","WilliamSchuler"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-linguistic-theories,-cognitive-modeling,-and-psycholinguistics-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4728","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77993/poster_document/4f8d1f2fe6eb92a111862b5b11150b1b.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77993/poster/5ebc38d3fd77db8b7d3cee123e9ecfae.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Categorial grammar induction from raw data","tldr":"Grammar induction, the task of learning a set of grammatical rules from raw or minimally labeled text data, can provide clues about what kinds of syntactic structures are learnable without prior knowl...","track":"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics","underline_id":77993,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/77993-categorial-grammar-induction-from-raw-data","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52188/file/e2219b4a77e7ecca3315e76a612c54e9.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085055Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e026b5d50806a30dce126b33e9fde476194f1ea913e72a2e63455a938b4204db"},{"abstract":"We present a novel end-to-end generative task and system for predicting event factuality holders, targets, and their associated factuality values.

The results of these experiments demonstrate the presence of complex stereotypical behaviors in image generations.","authors":["JialuWang","XinyueGabbyLiu","ZonglinDi","YangLiu","XinEricWang"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-ethics-and-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4937","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"T2IAT: Measuring Valence and Stereotypical Biases in Text-to-Image Generation","tldr":"*Warning: This paper contains several contents that may be toxic, harmful, or offensive.*\n\nIn the last few years, text-to-image generative models have gained remarkable success in generating images wi...","track":"Ethics and NLP","underline_id":78021,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/78021-t2iat-measuring-valence-and-stereotypical-biases-in-text-to-image-generation","video_url":null},{"abstract":"Code execution is a fundamental aspect of programming language semantics that reflects the exact behavior of the code. However, most pre-trained models for code intelligence ignore the execution trace and only rely on source code and syntactic structures. In this paper, we investigate how well pre-trained models can understand and perform code execution. We develop a mutation-based data augmentation technique to create a large-scale and realistic Python dataset and task for code execution, which challenges existing models such as Codex. We then present CodeExecutor, a Transformer model that leverages code execution pre-training and curriculum learning to enhance its semantic comprehension. We evaluate CodeExecutor on code execution and show its promising performance and limitations. We also demonstrate its potential benefits for code intelligence tasks such as zero-shot code-to-code search and text-to-code generation. Our analysis provides insights into the learning and generalization abilities of pre-trained models for code execution.","authors":["ChenxiaoLiu","ShuaiLu","WeizhuChen","DaxinJiang","AlexeySvyatkovskiy","ShengyuFu","NeelSundaresan","NanDuan"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-large-language-models-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P495","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/77327/poster_document/c7cc5641b6554e995a0b6fefebbea09d.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Code Execution with Pre-trained Language Models","tldr":"Code execution is a fundamental aspect of programming language semantics that reflects the exact behavior of the code.

However, in real-world applications, there exists an infinite label space for describing a given text. In addition, depending on the aspect (sentiment, topic, etc.) and domain of the text (finance, legal, etc.), the interpretation of the label can vary greatly. This makes the task of text classification, particularly in the zero-shot scenario, extremely challenging. In this paper, we investigate the task of zero-shot text classification with the aim of improving the ability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to generalize to both seen and unseen data across varying aspects and domains. To solve this we introduce two new simple yet effective pre-training strategies, Implicit and Explicit pre-training. These methods inject aspect-level understanding into the model at train time with the goal of conditioning the model to build task-level understanding. To evaluate this, we construct and release UTCD, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating text classification in zero-shot settings. Experimental results on UTCD show that our approach achieves improved zero-shot generalization on a suite of challenging datasets across an array of zero-shot formalizations.","authors":["ChristopherClarke","YuzhaoHeng","YipingKang","KrisztianFlautner","LingjiaTang","JasonMars"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-machine-learning-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-centre',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P4956","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78024/poster_document/0a5ac3943278d692717ea724440720c8.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78024/poster/2efaf374ba1c61161a63899964dc10ea.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Label Agnostic Pre-training for Zero-shot Text Classification","tldr":"Conventional approaches to text classification typically assume the existence of a fixed set of predefined labels to which a given text can be classified.

Second, the generated scene graphs have high inconsistency, with the same semantics represented by different annotations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel dataset, which involves re-annotating the captions in Visual Genome (VG) using a new intermediate representation called FACTUAL-MR.

Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that the parser trained on our dataset outperforms existing approaches in terms of faithfulness and consistency. This improvement leads to a significant performance boost in both image caption evaluation and zero-shot image retrieval tasks.

Using large language models such as GPT-3, we created semantically and syntactically diverse questions, then adopt the simple aggregation of the popular evaluation metrics as the final scores. Through our experiments, we found that using multiple (pseudo) references is more effective for QG evaluation while showing a higher correlation with human evaluations than evaluation with a single reference.","authors":["ShinhyeokOh","HyojunGo","HyeongdonMoon","YunsungLee","MyeonghoJeong","Hyun SeungLee","SeungtaekChoi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-generation-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5166","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"short","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78051/poster_document/75d6f43eb8fb5de63de0f6d601281b99.pdf","preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Evaluation of Question Generation Needs More References","tldr":"Question generation (QG) is the task of generating a valid and fluent question based on a given context and the target answer.

To address this problem, we propose a hybrid instance-filtering framework (BoostAug) based on pre-trained language models that can maintain a similar feature space with natural datasets.

We propose to disentangle the per-evidence relevance probability and its contribution to the final veracity probability in an interpretable way --- the final veracity probability is proportional to a linear ensemble of per-evidence relevance probabilities. In this way, the individual contributions of evidences towards the final predicted probability can be identified. In per-evidence relevance probability, our model can further distinguish whether each relevant evidence is supporting (S) or refuting (R) the claim. This allows to quantify how much the S/R probability contributes to final verdict or to detect disagreeing evidence. Despite its interpretable nature, our system achieves results competetive with state-of-the-art on the FEVER dataset, as compared to typical two-stage system pipelines, while using significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, our analysis shows that our model can learn fine-grained relevance cues while using coarse-grained supervision and we demonstrate it in 2 ways. (i) We show that our model can achieve competitive sentence recall while using only paragraph-level relevance supervision. (ii) Traversing towards the finest granularity of relevance, we show that our model is capable of identifying relevance at the token level. To do this, we present a new benchmark TLR-FEVER focusing on token-level interpretability ---  humans annotate tokens in relevant evidences they considered essential when making their judgment.

However, the effectiveness of dependency parse trees or the relative predictive power of the various syntax parsers across brain areas, especially for the listening task, is yet unexplored. In this study, we investigate the predictive power of the brain encoding models in three settings: (i) individual performance of the constituency and dependency syntactic parsing based embedding methods, (ii) efficacy of these syntactic parsing based embedding methods when controlling for basic syntactic signals, (iii) relative effectiveness of each of the syntactic embedding methods when controlling for the other. Further, we explore the relative importance of syntactic information (from these syntactic embedding methods) versus semantic information using BERT embeddings. We find that constituency parsers help explain activations in the temporal lobe and middle-frontal gyrus, while dependency parsers better encode syntactic structure in the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. Although semantic signals from BERT are more effective compared to any of the syntactic features or embedding methods, syntactic embedding methods explain additional variance for a few brain regions.","authors":["Subba ReddyOota","MounikaMarreddy","ManishGupta","RajuSurampudiBapi"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-linguistic-theories,-cognitive-modeling,-and-psycholinguistics-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5658","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"How does the brain process syntactic structure while listening?","tldr":"Syntactic parsing is the task of assigning a syntactic structure to a sentence.

A common practice for evaluating whether an interpretability method is faithful has been to use evaluation-by-agreement -- if multiple methods agree on an explanation, its credibility increases. However, recent work has found that saliency methods exhibit weak rank correlations even when applied to the same model instance and advocated for alternative diagnostic methods. In our work, we demonstrate that rank correlation is not a good fit for evaluating agreement and argue that Pearson-r is a better-suited alternative. We further show that regularization techniques that increase faithfulness of attention explanations also increase agreement between saliency methods. By connecting our findings to instance categories based on training dynamics, we show that the agreement of saliency method explanations is very low for easy-to-learn instances. Finally, we connect the improvement in agreement across instance categories to local representation space statistics of instances, paving the way for work on analyzing which intrinsic model properties improve their predisposition to interpretability methods.","authors":["JosipJuki\u0107","MartinTutek","JanSnajder"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-1_-interpretability-and-analysis-of-models-for-nlp-(virtual-poster)"],"forum":"","id":"P5660","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78111/poster_document/6f1a3e431a9cea56700231317296a9a6.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78111/poster/de5f67748f3fc6501f94d2f31de94db5.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Easy to Decide, Hard to Agree: Reducing Disagreements Between Saliency Methods","tldr":"A popular approach to unveiling the black box of neural NLP models is to leverage saliency methods, which assign scalar importance scores to each input component.

However, the computational principles that lead to this learning trajectory remain largely unknown. To investigate this, we here compare the learning trajectories of deep language models to those of human children.  Specifically, we test whether, during its training, GPT-2 exhibits stages of language acquisition comparable to those observed in children aged between 18 months and 6 years. For this, we train 48 GPT-2 models from scratch and evaluate their syntactic and semantic abilities at each training step, using 96 probes curated from the BLiMP, Zorro and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We then compare these evaluations with the behavior of 54 children during language production. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, similarly to children, the language models tend to learn linguistic skills in a systematic order. Second, this learning scheme is parallel: the language tasks that are learned last improve from the very first training steps. Third, some -- but not all -- learning stages are shared between children and these language models. Overall, these results shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlight important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process natural language.","authors":["LinneaEvanson","YairLakretz","Jean R\u00e9miKing"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Findings","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-7_-linguistic-theories,-cognitive-modeling,-and-psycholinguistics-(virtual-poster)","spotlight_-('metropolitan-west',)-(spotlight)"],"forum":"","id":"P5739","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"long","poster_pdf":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78126/poster_document/2bbfe612e52c4f35b50b597eb06f8464.pdf","preview_image":"https://assets.underline.io/lecture/78126/poster/2457c0a72d582a3cadd04e2de0ea18af.png","program":"Findings","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"Language acquisition: do children and language models follow similar learning stages?","tldr":"During language acquisition, children follow a typical sequence of learning stages, whereby they first learn to categorize phonemes before they develop their lexicon and eventually master increasingly...","track":"Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics","underline_id":78126,"underline_url":"https://underline.io/lecture/78126-language-acquisition-do-children-and-language-models-follow-similar-learning-stagesquestion","video_url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/underline.prod/video/52240/file/675da712287bc804a54ed935c9b87810.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZP4XRUPAQFEPSF6P%2F20230622%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230622T085056Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6c76bbe3183d184402d5c5156ca36dfe86aa545c0fae8139c6b654404e00edd8"},{"abstract":"Privatized text rewriting with local differential privacy (LDP) is a recent approach that enables sharing of sensitive textual documents while formally guaranteeing privacy protection to individuals.

The model needs to cope with challenging lexical constraints that are \"homographs\" or \"unseen\" during training. To this end, we first design a homograph disambiguation module to differentiate the meanings of homographs. Moreover, we propose PLUMCOT which integrates contextually rich information about unseen lexical constraints from pre-trained language models and strengthens a copy mechanism of the pointer network via direct supervision of a copying score. We also release HOLLY, an evaluation benchmark for assessing the ability of model to cope with \"homographic\" and \"unseen\" lexical constraints. Experiments on HOLLY and the previous test setup show the effectiveness of our method.

However, these models still suffer from a prediction bias due to their unidirectional decoding. Thus, we propose a bidirectional Transformer reranker (BTR), that re-estimates the probability of each candidate sentence generated by the pre-trained seq2seq model. The BTR preserves the seq2seq-style Transformer architecture but utilizes a BERT-style self-attention mechanism in the decoder to compute the probability of each target token by using masked language modeling to capture bidirectional representations from the target context. For guiding the reranking, the BTR adopts negative sampling in the objective function to minimize the unlikelihood. During inference, the BTR gives final results after comparing the reranked top-1 results with the original ones by an acceptance threshold. Experimental results show that, in reranking candidates from a pre-trained seq2seq model, T5-base, the BTR on top of T5-base could yield 65.47 and 71.27 F0.5 scores on the CoNLL-14 and BEA test sets, respectively, and yield 59.52 GLEU score on the JFLEG corpus, with improvements of 0.36, 0.76 and 0.48 points compared with the original T5-base.

Most previous studies are limited to the transductive setting where all entities must be seen during the training, making them unable to perform reasoning on emerging entities. Recently, the inductive setting is proposed to handle the entities in the test phase to be unseen during training, However, it suffers from the inefficient reasoning under the enclosing subgraph extraction issue and the lack of effective entity-independent feature modeling.  To this end, we propose a novel Query Adaptive Anchor Representation (QAAR)  model for inductive relation prediction. First, we extract one opening subgraph and perform reasoning by one time for all candidate triples, which is more efficient when the number of candidate triples is large. Second, we define some query adaptive anchors which are independent on any specific entity.

Additionally, previous work on pretrained Hebrew LMs focused on encoder-only models. While the encoder-only architecture is beneficial for classification tasks, it does not cater well for sub-word prediction tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, when considering the morphologically rich nature of Hebrew. In this paper we argue that sequence-to-sequence generative architectures are more suitable for large LMs in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew. We demonstrate this by casting tasks in the Hebrew NLP pipeline as text-to-text tasks, for which we can leverage powerful multilingual, pretrained sequence-to-sequence models as mT5, eliminating the need for a separate, specialized, morpheme-based, decoder. Using this approach, our experiments show substantial improvements over previously published results on all existing Hebrew NLP benchmarks.

The relationship between inputs and possible outputs/behaviors represents the functions/subroutines and profiles the program as a whole. Hence, we propose to incorporate such a relationship into learning, for achieving a deeper semantic understanding of programs. To obtain inputs that are representative enough to trigger the execution of most part of the code, we resort to fuzz testing and propose fuzz tuning to boost the performance of program understanding and code representation learning, given a pre-trained LLM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on two program understanding tasks including code clone detection and code classification, and it outperforms current state-of-the-arts by large margins.

Experimental results on explanation-based zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that CLORE is superior to baselines, which we show is mainly due to higher scores on tasks requiring more logical reasoning. We also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to zero-shot classification on visual modality.
