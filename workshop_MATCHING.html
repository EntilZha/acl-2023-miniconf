      Matching Entities from structured and unstructured sources is an important task in many  domains and applications such as HR and E-commerce. For example, in HR platforms/services, it is important to match resumes to job descriptions and job seekers to companies. Similarly in web platforms/services, it is important to match customers to businesses such as hotels and restaurant, among others. In such domains, it is also relevant to match “textual customer reviews” to customers queries, and sentences (or phrases) as answers to customer questions. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Conversational AI, Language Generation, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Management, Information Extraction, Knowledge Bases/Graphs, (MultiSingle Hop/Commonsense) Inference/Reasoning, Recommendation Systems, and others, have demonstrated promising results in different Matching tasks related (but not limited) to the previously mentioned domains. We believe that there is tremendous opportunity to further exploit and explore the use of advanced NLP (and language related) techniques applied to Matching tasks. Therefore, the goal of this workshop is to bring together the research communities (from academia and industry) of these related areas, that are interested in the development and the application of novel natural-language-based approaches/models/systems to address challenges around different Matching tasks.

            ECOLA: Enhancing Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language Representations

            <p class="card-text">Since conventional knowledge embedding models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information, there have been extensive research efforts in enhancing knowledge embedding using texts. However, existing enhancement approaches cannot apply to temporal knowledge graphs (tKGs), which contain time-dependent event knowledge with complex temporal dynamics. Specifically, existing enhancement approaches often assume knowledge embedding is time-independent. In contrast, the entity embedding in tKG models usually evolves, which poses the challenge of aligning temporally relevant texts with entities. To this end, we propose to study enhancing temporal knowledge embedding with textual data in this paper. As an approach to this task, we propose Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language Representations (ECOLA), which takes the temporal aspect into account and injects textual information into temporal knowledge embedding. To evaluate ECOLA, we introduce three new datasets for training and evaluating ECOLA. Extensive experiments show that ECOLA significantly enhances temporal KG embedding models with up to 287% relative improvements regarding Hits@1 on the link prediction task. The code and models are publicly available.</p>

            Easy-to-Hard Learning for Information Extraction

            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Chang Gao, Wenxuan Zhang, Wai Lam, Lidong Bing</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Information extraction (IE) systems aim to automatically extract structured information, such as named entities, relations between entities, and events, from unstructured texts. While most existing work addresses a particular IE task, universally modeling various IE tasks with one model has achieved great success recently. Despite their success, they employ a one-stage learning strategy, i.e., directly learning to extract the target structure given the input text, which contradicts the human learning process. In this paper, we propose a unified easy-to-hard learning framework consisting of three stages, i.e., the easy stage, the hard stage, and the main stage, for IE by mimicking the human learning process. By breaking down the learning process into multiple stages, our framework facilitates the model to acquire general IE task knowledge and improve its generalization ability. Extensive experiments across four IE tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on 13 out of 17 datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/IE-E2H.</p>

            INFOSYNC: Information Synchronization across Multilingual Semi-structured Tables

            <p class="card-text">Information Synchronization of semi-structured data across languages is challenging. For instance, Wikipedia tables in one language should be synchronized across languages. To address this problem, we introduce a new dataset INFOSYNC and a two-step method for tabular synchronization. INFOSYNC contains 100K entity-centric tables (Wikipedia Infoboxes) across 14 languages, of which a subset (∼3.5K pairs) are manually annotated. The proposed method includes 1) Information Alignment to map rows and 2) Information Update for updating missing/outdated information for aligned tables across multilingual tables. When evaluated on INFOSYNC, information alignment achieves an F1 score of 87.91 (en ↔ non-en). To evaluate information updation, we perform human-assisted Wikipedia edits on Infoboxes for 603 table pairs. Our approach obtains an acceptance rate of 77.28% on Wikipedia, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            Aligning Instruction Tasks Unlocks Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Relation Extractors
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Kai Zhang, Bernal Gutiérrez, Yu Su</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on large-scale instruction-following datasets substantially improves their performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, especially in the zero-shot setting. However, even advanced instruction-tuned LLMs still fail to outperform small LMs on relation extraction (RE), a fundamental information extraction task. We hypothesize that instruction-tuning has been unable to elicit strong RE capabilities in LLMs due to RE’s low incidence in instruction-tuning datasets, making up less than 1% of all tasks (Wang et al., 2022). To address this limitation, we propose QA4RE, a framework that aligns RE with question answering (QA), a predominant task in instruction-tuning datasets. Comprehensive zero-shot RE experiments over four datasets with two series of instruction-tuned LLMs (six LLMs in total) demonstrate that our QA4RE framework consistently improves LLM performance, strongly verifying our hypothesis and enabling LLMs to outperform strong zero-shot baselines by a large margin. Additionally, we provide thorough experiments and discussions to show the robustness, few-shot effectiveness, and strong transferability of our QA4RE framework. This work illustrates a promising way of adapting LLMs to challenging and underrepresented tasks by aligning these tasks with more common instruction-tuning tasks like QA.</p>

            Text-To-KG Alignment: Comparing Current Methods on Classification Tasks
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Sondre Wold, Lilja Øvrelid, Erik Velldal</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In contrast to large text corpora, knowledge graphs (KG) provide dense and structured representations of factual information. This makes them attractive for systems that supplement or ground the knowledge found in pre-trained language models with an external knowledge source. This has especially been the case for classification tasks, where recent work has focused on creating pipeline models that retrieve information from KGs like ConceptNet as additional context. Many of these models consist of multiple components, and although they differ in the number and nature of these parts, they all have in common that for some given text query, they attempt to identify and retrieve a relevant subgraph from the KG. Due to the noise and idiosyncrasies often found in KGs, it is not known how current methods compare to a scenario where the aligned subgraph is completely relevant to the query. In this work, we try to bridge this knowledge gap by reviewing current approaches to text-to-KG alignment and evaluating them on two datasets where manually created graphs are available, providing insights into the effectiveness of current methods. We release our code for reproducibility.</p>

            Corpus-Based Task-Specific Relation Discovery
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Karthik Ramanan</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Relation extraction is a crucial language processing task for various downstream applications, including knowledge base completion, question answering, and summarization. Traditional relation-extraction techniques, however, rely on a predefined set of relations and model the extraction as a classification task. Consequently, such closed-world extraction methods are insufficient for inducing novel relations from a corpus. Unsupervised techniques like OpenIE, which extract &lt;head, relation, tail&gt; triples, generate relations that are too general for practical information extraction applications. In this work, we contribute the following: 1) We motivate and introduce a new task, corpus-based task-specific relation discovery. 2) We adapt existing data sources to create Wiki-Art, a novel dataset for task-specific relation discovery. 3) We develop a novel framework for relation discovery using zero-shot entity linking, prompting, and type-specific clustering. Our approach effectively connects unstructured text spans to their shared underlying relations, bridging the data-representation gap and significantly outperforming baselines on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our code and data are available in our GitHub repository.</p>

            On the Surprising Effectiveness of Name Matching Alone in Autoregressive Entity Linking
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Elliot Schumacher, James Mayfield, Mark Dredze</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Fifteen years of work on entity linking has established the importance of different information sources in making linking decisions: mention and entity name similarity, contextual relevance, and features of the knowledge base. Modern state-of-the-art systems build on these features, including through neural representations (Wu et al., 2020). In contrast to this trend, the autoregressive language model GENRE (De Cao et al., 2021) generates normalized entity names for mentions and beats many other entity linking systems, despite making no use of knowledge base (KB) information. How is this possible? We analyze the behavior of GENRE on several entity linking datasets and demonstrate that its performance stems from memorization of name patterns. In contrast, it fails in cases that might benefit from using the KB.

            Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering

            <p class="card-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of performing zero-shot closed-book question answering tasks, based on their internal knowledge stored in parameters during pre-training. However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAPING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user’s question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.</p>

            CoSiNES: Contrastive Siamese Network for Entity Standardization

            <p class="card-text">Entity standardization maps noisy mentions from free-form text to standard entities in a knowledge base. The unique challenge of this task relative to other entity-related tasks is the lack of surrounding context and numerous variations in the surface form of the mentions, especially when it comes to generalization across domains where labeled data is scarce. Previous research mostly focuses on developing models either heavily relying on context, or dedicated solely to a specific domain. In contrast, we propose CoSiNES, a generic and adaptable framework with Contrastive Siamese Network for Entity Standardization that effectively adapts a pretrained language model to capture the syntax and semantics of the entities in a new domain. We construct a new dataset in the technology domain, which contains 640 technical stack entities and 6,412 mentions collected from industrial content management systems. We demonstrate that CoSiNES yields higher accuracy and faster runtime than baselines derived from leading methods in this domain. CoSiNES also achieves competitive performance in four standard datasets from the chemistry, medicine, and biomedical domains, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

            Identifying Quantifiably Verifiable Statements from Text
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Pegah Jandaghi, Jay Pujara</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Humans often describe complex quantitative data using trend-based patterns. Trend-based patterns can be interpreted as higher order functions and relations over numerical data such as extreme values, rates of change, or cyclical repetition. One application where trends abound are descriptions of numerical tabular data. Therefore, the alignment of numerical tables and textual description of trends enables easier interpretations of tables. Most existing approaches can align quantities in text with tabular data but are unable to detect and align trend-based patterns about data. In this paper, we introduce the initial steps for aligning trend-based patterns about the data, i.e. the detection of textual description of trends and the alignment of trends with a relevant table. We introduce the problem of identifying quantifiably verifiable statements (QVS) in the text and aligning them with tables and datasets. We define the structure of these statements and implement a structured based detection. In our experiments, we demonstrate our method can detect and align these statements from several domains and compare favorably with traditional sequence labeling methods.</p>

            Toward Consistent and Informative Event-Event Temporal Relation Extraction

            <p class="card-text">Event-event temporal relation extraction aims to extract the temporal order between a pair of event mentions, which is usually used to construct temporal event graphs. However, event graphs generated by existing methods are usually globally inconsistent (event graphs containing cycles), semantically irrelevant (two unrelated events having temporal links), and context unaware (neglecting neighborhood information of an event node). In this paper, we propose a novel event-event temporal relation extraction method to address these limitations. Our model combines a pretrained language model and a graph neural network to output event embeddings, which captures the contextual information of event graphs. Moreover, to achieve global consistency and semantic relevance, (1) event temporal order should be in accordance with the norm of their embeddings, and (2) two events have temporal relation only if their embeddings are close enough. Experimental results on a real-world event dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates high-quality event graphs.</p>

            COFFEE: A Contrastive Oracle-Free Framework for Event Extraction
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Authors: Meiru Zhang, Yixuan Su, Zaiqiao Meng, Zihao Fu, Nigel Collier</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Event extraction is a complex task that involves extracting events from unstructured text. Prior classification-based methods require comprehensive entity annotations for joint training, while newer generation-based methods rely on heuristic templates containing oracle information such as event type, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. In this study, we consider a more realistic task setting, namely the Oracle-Free Event Extraction (OFEE) task, where only the input context is given, without any oracle information including event type, event ontology, or trigger word. To address this task, we propose a new framework, COFFEE. This framework extracts events solely based on the document context, without referring to any oracle information. In particular, COFFEE introduces a contrastive selection model to refine the generated triggers and handle multi-event instances. Our proposed COFFEE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the oracle-free setting of the event extraction task, as evaluated on two public variants of the ACE05 benchmark. The code used in our study has been made publicly available.</p>
