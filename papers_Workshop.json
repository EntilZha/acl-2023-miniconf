While this aspiration has led to improvements in benchmark performance of (predominantly neural) models, it has also came at a cost, i.e., increased model complexity and the ever-growing amount of computational resources required for training and using the current state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the recent research efforts have, for the most part, failed to identify sources of empirical gains in models, often failing to empirically justify the model complexity beyond benchmark performance\n\nBecause of these easily observable trends, we have proposed the SustaiNLP workshop with the goal of promoting more sustainable NLP research and practices, with two main objectives: (1) encouraging development of more efficient NLP models; and (2) providing simpler architectures and empirical justification of model complexity.

Significant recent work has focused on tasks that require some kind of natural language reasoning. A trajectory in question answering has led us from extraction-oriented datasets like SQuAD to \u201cmulti-hop\u201d reasoning datasets like HotpotQA and StrategyQA. Although LLMs have shown remarkable performance on most NLP tasks, it is often unclear why their answers follow from what they know. To address this gap, a new class of explanation techniques has emerged which play an integral part in structuring the reasoning necessary to solve these datasets. For example, the chain-of-thought paradigm leverages explanations as vehicles for LLMs to mimic human reasoning processes. Entailment trees offer a way to ground multi-step reasoning in a collection of verifiable steps. Frameworks like SayCan bridge high-level planning in language and with low-level action trajectories. As a result, we see a confluence of methods blending explainable machine learning/NLP, classical AI (especially theorem proving), and cognitive science (how do humans structure explanations?). This workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of perspectives from these different traditions and attempt to establish common ground for how these various kinds of explanation structures can tackle a broad class of reasoning problems in natural language and beyond.<br>For more details visit our workshop website: https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["w8_-the-1st-workshop-on-natural-language-reasoning-and-structured-explanations_-w8_-the-1st-workshop-on-natural-language-reasoning-and-structured-explanations-(workshops)"],"forum":"","id":"p_w8_-the-1st-workshop-on-natural-language-reasoning-and-structured-explanations_-w8_-the-1st-workshop-on-natural-language-reasoning-and-structured-explanations-(workshops)","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Workshops","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Workshop","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"W8: The 1st Workshop on Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations","tldr":"","track":"w8_-the-1st-workshop-on-natural-language-reasoning-and-structured-explanations","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"The goal of The Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH) is to advance research that develops, interrogates and applies computational methods for detecting, classifying and modelling online abuse.<br>For more details visit our workshop website: https://www.workshopononlineabuse.com/","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["w9_-the-7th-workshop-on-online-abuse-and-harms-(woah)_-w9_-the-7th-workshop-on-online-abuse-and-harms-(woah)-(workshops)"],"forum":"","id":"p_w9_-the-7th-workshop-on-online-abuse-and-harms-(woah)_-w9_-the-7th-workshop-on-online-abuse-and-harms-(woah)-(workshops)","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Workshops","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Workshop","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"W9: The 7th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH)","tldr":"","track":"w9_-the-7th-workshop-on-online-abuse-and-harms-(woah)","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"### [**Program**](https://doc2dial.github.io/workshop2023/#program)\nThe DialDoc workshop focuses on Document-Grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering.

The interest to biomedical language has broadened significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow: as access to information becomes easier and more people generate and access health-related text, it becomes clearer that only language technologies can enable and support adequate use of the biomedical text.\n\nBioNLP 2023 will be particularly interested in language processing that supports DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility). The work on detection and mitigation of bias and misinformation continues to be of interest. Research in languages other than English, particularly, under-represented languages, and health disparities are always of interest to BioNLP.<br>For more details visit our workshop website: https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/BioNLP_Workshop","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["w13_-the-22nd-workshop-on-biomedical-natural-language-processing-and-shared-tasks-(bionlp-st)_-w13_-the-22nd-workshop-on-biomedical-natural-language-processing-and-shared-tasks-(bionlp-st)-(workshops)"],"forum":"","id":"p_w13_-the-22nd-workshop-on-biomedical-natural-language-processing-and-shared-tasks-(bionlp-st)_-w13_-the-22nd-workshop-on-biomedical-natural-language-processing-and-shared-tasks-(bionlp-st)-(workshops)","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Workshops","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Workshop","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"W13: The 22nd Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing and Shared Tasks (BioNLP-ST)","tldr":"","track":"w13_-the-22nd-workshop-on-biomedical-natural-language-processing-and-shared-tasks-(bionlp-st)","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"Over the past decades, mathematicians, linguists, and computer scientists have dedicated their efforts towards empowering human-machine communication in natural language.

In addition to traditional examples such as personal voice assistants, recommender systems, etc, more recent developments include content-generation models such as ChatGPT, text-to-image models (Dall-E), and so on. While these emergent technologies have an unquestionable potential to power various innovative NLP and AI applications, they also pose a number of challenges in terms of their safe and ethical use. To address such challenges, NLP researchers have formulated various objectives, e.g., intended to make models more fair, safe, and privacy-preserving. However, these objectives are often considered separately, which is a major limitation since it is often important to understand the interplay and/or tension between them. For instance, meeting a fairness objective might require access to users\u2019 demographic information, which creates tension with privacy objectives. The goal of this workshop is to move toward a more comprehensive notion of Trustworthy NLP, by bringing together researchers working on those distinct yet related topics, as well as their intersection.<br>\nFor more details visit our workshop website: https://trustnlpworkshop.github.io/","authors":[],"card_image_path":"","category":"","demo_url":"","event_ids":["w15_-the-3rd-workshop-on-trustworthy-nlp-(trustnlp)_-w15_-the-3rd-workshop-on-trustworthy-nlp-(trustnlp)-(workshops)"],"forum":"","id":"p_w15_-the-3rd-workshop-on-trustworthy-nlp-(trustnlp)_-w15_-the-3rd-workshop-on-trustworthy-nlp-(trustnlp)-(workshops)","keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"Workshops","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Workshop","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"W15: The 3rd Workshop on Trustworthy NLP (TrustNLP)","tldr":"","track":"w15_-the-3rd-workshop-on-trustworthy-nlp-(trustnlp)","underline_id":null,"underline_url":null,"video_url":null},{"abstract":"### [Program](https://wassa-workshop.github.io/2023/schedule/)\nSubjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has become a highly developed research area, ranging from binary classification of reviews to the detection of complex emotion structures between entities found in text.

For example, a buyer uses social influence skills to engage in trade-offs and build rapport when bargaining with a seller. A therapist uses social influence skills like persuasion to motivate a patient towards physical exercise. Social influence is a core function of human communication, and such scenarios are ubiquitous in everyday life, from negotiations to argumentation to behavioral interventions. Consequently, realistic human-machine conversations must reflect these social influence dynamics, making it essential to systematically model and understand them in dialogue research.
