In the case of written communication, users with a good command of a foreign language may find assistance from computer-aided translation (CAT) technologies. These technologies often allow users to access external resources, such as dictionaries, terminologies or bilingual concordancers, thereby interrupting and considerably hindering the writing process. In addition, CAT systems assume that the source sentence is fixed and also restrict the possible changes on the target side. In order to make the writing process smoother, we present BiSync, a bilingual writing assistant that allows users to freely compose text in two languages, while maintaining the two monolingual texts synchronized. We also include additional functionalities, such as the display of alternative prefix translations and paraphrases, which are intended to facilitate the authoring of texts. We detail the model architecture used for synchronization and evaluate the resulting tool, showing that high accuracy can be attained with limited computational resources.

We prepopulate the package with connotation frames of sentiment, power, and agency, which have demonstrated usefulness for capturing social phenomena, such as gender bias, in a broad range of corpora. For decades, lexical frameworks have been foundational tools in computational social science, digital humanities, and natural language processing, facilitating multifaceted analysis of text corpora. But working with verb-centric lexica specifically requires natural language processing skills, reducing their accessibility to other researchers. By organizing the language processing pipeline, providing complete lexicon scores and visualizations for all entities in a corpus, and providing functionality for users to target specific research questions, Riveter greatly improves the accessibility of verb lexica and can facilitate a broad range of future research.","authors":["Maria Antoniak","Anjalie Field","Jimin Mun","Melanie Walsh","Lauren Klein","Maarten Sap"],"card_image_path":"","category":"Demo","demo_url":null,"event_ids":["session-4_-information-extraction-(demo)-(poster)"],"forum":"","id":"D94","is_paper":true,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_pdf":null,"paper_type":"nan","poster_pdf":null,"preview_image":null,"program":"Demo","similar_paper_ids":[],"slides_pdf":null,"title":"[Demo] Riveter: Measuring Power and Social Dynamics Between Entities","tldr":"Riveter provides a complete easy-to-use pipeline for analyzing verb connotations associated with entities in text corpora.

We compare two Transformer-based models, a character-level encoder-decoder model and a byte-level encoder-only model. We find that the encoder-only model is both faster and achieves higher quality. We provide an easy-to-use tool that is over 900 times faster than the previous best tool, with the same high quality.
